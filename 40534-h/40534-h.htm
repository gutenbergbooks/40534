<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>To all Flower Lovers who may read these pages, we come with kindly greetings.
To you we dedicate our Work.</p>

<p>Encouraged by the many testimonials of favor with which our Flower Sketches have
been received, which have appeared in the <i>Boston Journal</i>, <i>Portland Transcript</i>, and
the leading Floricultural journals, we were induced to prepare this volume, intending
it to be made up chiefly of those articles revised and enlarged for this purpose; but
after entering upon this work, we found so little that was adapted for use, nearly every
page has been written while the sheets were passing through the press.</p>

<p>Before we were aware, the printed matter had exceeded our proposed limits, and we
were obliged to enlarge the work by additional pages, and even then omit our chapter
of "Floricultural Notes," for we wished to put the book at a low price, that it might
reach the masses. As it is, we are sure that we have given you a great amount of valuable
information, and just such as amateurs need, respecting the habits and requirements
of those flowers which are best adapted for general cultivation, and in a form
specially new and attractive, combining the <i>history</i> and <i>literature</i> of flowers, with description
and mode of culture.</p>

<p>It may be deemed strange that we should omit from a work of this character a
"Talk" about the Queen of Flowers, but the subject was so full that we thought best to
devote the space to other varieties and refer our readers to our recently published
"Essay on Roses,"&mdash;advertised in another part of this work&mdash;in which they will find
the subject fully treated.</p>

<p>We would here acknowledge our obligation to Mr. James Vick for the beautiful Bouquet
of Flowers which constitutes our Frontispiece.</p>

<img src="images/i_008b.jpg" class="dropcap" alt="I" title="I" height="95" width="51" />
<span class="hidden" >I</span>HAVE been thinking for some time of writing a few articles
about flowers, not for the entertainment nor instruction
of those who have extensive gardens artistically laid out,
and fine conservatories with skilled gardeners to care for
the rare and costly plants, but for those, who, like myself, have only
a few beds filled with flowers, cared for by one's own self.</p>

<p>Every year there is a marked advance in the floricultural kingdom.
Books and periodicals devoted to flower culture are on the
increase; florists are enlarging their domain; catalogues are scattered
broadcast, and as free as autumn leaves, some of them
beautiful with their colored plates, handsome enough to frame. Very
many of the literary, religious, and political journals of the day
have their floral department, in which the ladies gossip of their
experience and exchange opinions, and we doubt if any column is
read with greater interest.</p>

<p>What recreation for the mind and body more pure, refining,
healthful, than that of the cultivation of flowers? How they reveal
the Father's love, and wisdom, and power! How perfect his work!
Very fully have I realized this, as I have examined bud, blossom,
and leaf under the microscope. Its magnifying power when applied
to man's work, reveals coarseness and imperfection, but in God's
work only reveals new beauties, and greater perfectness. The tiny
flower, the details of which cannot be perceived by the eye unaided,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
when magnified, surprises us with its loveliness. We wonder and
adore that Being whose hand created its perfect form and arranged
its tints with so much harmony. The study of flowers with the
microscope is one of never failing delight, and one needs not the
costly instrument to enjoy this study. The round open glass, the
size of a half dollar, and costing the same, serves every needful
purpose.</p>

<p>Not only have I enjoyed the examination of flowers, but also of
insect life, specially of those terrible pests to our rosebushes and
some other plants&mdash;the <i>aphides</i>. I have closely watched their
development, from the tiny egg to the portly insect, so filled with
the juice of the leaf, that like it, he is green all over. First I observe
a little speck of red in the egg&mdash;then it has slight motion&mdash;next
it runs about, and the spot is a little larger, sometimes it is
black. Sometimes the baby aphis is all red. Now and then I find
a different sort mixed up with them; the body is much larger and
transparent white. Some have wings. Skeletons, or more properly,
cast-off skins, are often seen, but with the closest observation
I have never been able to trace these to their source. Once, I was
sure that a fellow was divesting himself of his overcoat, and I
watched him till my eyes ached too badly for further investigation.</p>

<p>These insects are the cows of a certain species of ant, and I am
sure they are quite welcome to all I have, provided they will have
their yard on other premises, though I would like to detain them
long enough to see the milking process. Some have seen it and
written about it, so, strange as it seems, it is no fiction.</p>

<p>In this series of articles which I have entitled "Talks About
Flowers," I shall, in a very informal manner, talk to you about just
those matters pertaining to the flower garden, in which beginners and
amateurs are interested; to this class I belong; I am not a
skilled florist, my experience is limited; I am only a student in the
lower classes of floriculture, but I dearly love my lessons. I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
acquiring knowledge both from books and personal observation, and
I shall enjoy imparting to those not so favored with time and
resources the results of this study, believing it will be duly appreciated
by my readers, and their interest in the cultivation of flowers
be thereby increased. I shall talk to you about the sowing of seeds,
the arrangement of your garden, the plants with which to stock it,
treating of them historically and descriptively, with mode of culture.
I shall talk to you about the most desirable bulbs, about climbing
plants, hanging pots, and the window garden, and shall seek to meet
in all these the wishes of many inquirers.</p>

<span class="hidden">O</span>NCE more I take my pen in hand," as the old time
epistle was wont to begin. While a "Young Farmer"
discourseth of matters pertaining to the farm, I propose
to talk to farmers' wives and daughters of matters
relating to the flower garden. This article is specially dedicated
to them, and not to them as a whole, but to that class among them
who take no periodical devoted to flower culture, and find no time
even to study the various catalogues scattered broadcast, as sure
precursors of spring as are the falling leaves of autumn. Therefore
you who have your floral papers, your bay windows filled with plants,
or your fine conservatories, whether a farmer's wife or not, this is
not written for you, and you need not read any further.</p>

<p>There are many farmers' wives who give little attention to the
cultivation of flowers. Busy lives the most of them lead, and their
indoor work shuts them off largely from the enjoyment of those
beauties nature has so lavishly spread around them. It is a pity
that any of them should say, "I have no time to waste over flowers;
they bring neither food nor clothing."</p>

<p>Call that wasted time when tired, nervous, fretful perhaps, you
leave the heated rooms and run out to see if the seeds you sowed
last week have come up, or how the seedlings you set out are
thriving? To look at that opening rosebud, pick off the withered
leaves from the geranium, stir the earth a bit around that heliotrope,
and linger over the dear little pansies as their bright faces are up-turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
to greet you and cheer you with their diversified beauty?
Gather a few; they will bloom all the more because of it. There,
now, don't you feel nicely rested? The feeling of fretfulness is all
gone. Refreshed in body and mind, you resume your housework,
and accomplish it much more effectively than if you had kept right
on, so tired and all out of sorts. Better far these moments of out-door
recreation than blue pill or bitters. All this is anticipatory of
the "good time coming" to you this summer. That kind husband
of yours when he goes to the store to buy his garden seeds, or order
them from abroad, is going to include an equal number of flower
seeds. He would have done it long ago but he did not think anything
about it. But you are going to give him a hint this spring.
You can tell him that in the general seed box there is one corner
where are certain dainty little packages labeled Candytuft&mdash;purple,
carmine, white or mixed; Mignonnette, Aster, Balsam, Pink, Petunia,
Sweet Peas, etc., etc., and you tell him that those Sweet Peas bloom
the most fragrant blossoms for five months, while his "Extra
Early," whether "Blue Peter" or "Blue Tom Thumb," last only a
little while. So as he goes on his way he will think to himself,
"Wife works hard; she makes capital butter and keeps the house
real tidy, and I guess I must indulge her." When he returns home
he gives you those little packages, in each tiny brown seed of which
there lies hidden a beautiful life&mdash;a life that shall, by loving care,
develop "the red, white and blue" in settings of emerald, the influence
of which shall be felt by the entire household, and bring forth
a fruitage of brightness, gladness and love.</p>

<p>It may be that you live remote from the village store, or perhaps
there may not be kept there a good, reliable assortment of flower
seeds, so I will tell you what to do in that case, for I wish to be
helpful every step of the way. You must send to some good florist
for what you want, enclosing stamps, if for an amount less than one
dollar. You have your seeds now, and some of them need to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
started in the house in order to secure early flowers, Asters, Petunias,
Pinks, Pansies, Snapdragon and Sweet Peas. Sift your earth
through a coarse sieve. A little sharp sand is good to mix with it.
Shallow boxes are best, except for the peas. I use cigar boxes.
Dampen the earth, then sow thickly in rows, cover lightly with
more soil, dampen again, label, cover with paper so that the moisture
may not evaporate rapidly, and place in a sunny window. Daily
sprinkle through a fine rose pot, or with your fingers lightly if you
have none. However good your seeds may be, they will not grow
if kept dry, and will rot if kept too wet. The seedlings must be
nursed with care, not too much sun while tender. I do not thin
out mine till I transplant to the border, but many do, potting them
singly. Peas can be set out earliest of any. Sunny days in May
often tempt one to bed out their tender plants, and sow seed in
open ground; then come cold nights, when the fragile seedlings
need a hot soapstone to their feet. It is best to wait till warm
weather is fully established, and then choose a cloudy day for the
work. Protect from the sun's rays till the plants are established in
their new quarters. Now, all this looks like much work and care,
I know, but it is only a little work, a little care each day, and it is a
work that will be a restful change, and bring you better health and
better feelings, and when you gather the lovely flowers from the
seeds you have sown and cultured, you will not say: "My time was
all misspent."</p>

<span class="hidden">W</span>HEN the annual house cleaning treads heavily on the toes
of spring gardening, and one feels tempted to crowd the
work of two days into one, though sufficient for the present
is the work thereof. The bright warm days draw
one forth to spend "an hour or two" they say, and they mean it
too&mdash;with shovel or spade in hand to prepare the flower beds, but
the air is so refreshing, and there is so much to be done, that they
keep on "a little while longer," "just a few minutes more," till Sol
pours his burning rays down upon them with the unmistakable assurance
that it is near the hour of noon.</p>

<p>These are the days that try men's souls, and women's, too; days
when one wishes with Dudley Warner for a "cast iron back," but
would fain add the improvement of rubber hinges; days when the
inquiry is often provoked, "Will it pay?"</p>

<p>As we change the numerous boxes of seedlings from one position
to another, that they may catch the sunbeams, "Will it pay?" As
we take them out of doors these warm days, and bring them all
back again at night, lest the air prove too harsh for the tender things,
"Will it pay?"</p>

<p>Yes, we know from past experience that it will pay even a hundred
fold for all our care when the restful days shall come, and we
watch with hopeful hearts each bud of promise as it grows, and
gather our hands full of lovely flowers, the fruitage of our seed
sowing and unceasing care.</p>

<p>Have been bedding out to-day my old stocky geraniums, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
cutting off all the dead and unsightly branches. These were just
packed into large boxes in the autumn&mdash;as closely as possible&mdash;dirt
then thrown in to fill up the spaces, and they were put into the cellar
and severely let alone till the weather admitted of their being
taken out of doors.</p>

<p>Many throw away their geraniums, if the stalks decay by being
frost-bitten or for some other cause, when often the roots are alive,
and with proper care will sprout again. I had a few in my window
box that were touched by frost one intense cold night in December,
and died down to the roots. To my surprise, they sprouted in
March, for I did not suppose they would be seemingly lifeless so
long in a sunny window.</p>

<p>Some of my neighbors hang up their large geraniums by the
roots in the cellar, and thus keep them throughout the winter nicely,
but I have never been successful with this method.</p>

<p>My house plants are nearly all re-potted, ready to be plunged into
the ground the first of June. I put in a bit of potsherd to keep
the roots from going astray, then small pieces of coal for drainage,
then fill with mellow sifted soil, enriched with well-rotted manure.
I found it so much better last year to bed out in pots that I shall
practice it more fully this summer. When the time comes in the
autumn for taking them in doors, the work can be done in half the
time.</p>

<p>My seedlings will be six weeks or more in advance than those
sown in the open border. My sweet peas must go out very soon or
I shall have to give them a support, they are so tall.</p>

<p>Now I am going to tell you about another sort of a garden&mdash;"a
spick-span new" sort&mdash;and I know you will be pleased to hear about
it, and I think you will want to have one of your own.</p>


<h3><a id="THE_WILD_GARDEN"></a>THE WILD GARDEN.</h3>

<p>Mr. B. K. Bliss, of New York, in a note, said: "We have put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
into your box a packet of flower seeds for the wild garden, which
we think will interest you. We also send you the initial number
of our new paper, "<i>The American Garden</i>." In this journal I find
a very interesting article on "The Wild Garden," how to make it,
and a description of one at the country residence of Mr. M. S.
Beach, near Peekskill, from his own pen. We will quote a part of
it. He says: "We plowed a strip about six feet wide all around
a five-acre field, close to the fence. On this plowed ground, the
seed, previously well mixed, was thrown just as it happened to
come. The surface having afterwards been well smoothed over, we
waited the result. This proved satisfactory. We had a wild garden
indeed. The plants came up as thickly as they could grow, and
flourished and blossomed as freely as though they had enjoyed all
the care usually given to hot-house exotics.</p>

<p>"Sweet Alyssum, Mignonnette, the pretty blue Nemophila and
bright colored Phlox Drummondii seemed to cover the ground.
Morning Glories of every shade and delicate Cypress vines tried to
cover the fences and run up every tree. Quaint little yellow and
green Gourds appeared in the most unexpected places, and the
whole bed seemed to be ablaze with the orange and yellow of the
Eschscholtzia, Marigolds, Calendula Officinalis and Zinnias. One
of the chief charms of this wild flower bed was the variety and
change&mdash;not from season to season, but from day to day. Every
morning would find some new, unexpected, and previously forgotten
flower in bloom."</p>

<p>The packet of Flower Seeds for the "Wild Garden" consists of
more than a hundred varieties, sufficient for a square rod of ground.
There must needs be a peculiar charm in the "Wild Garden." When
one wearies of the monotonous ribbon beds and geometrical designs
so long in fashion, they can turn to the spot where flowers
run riot at their own sweet will, and give daily surprises because
sown broadcast without any regard to their names and location.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Multitudes there are, who, with abundance of land at their command,
can have one on a large scale, others can have, but a small
spot. There are many who have ground specially adapted by its
wildness for the blending of the cultivated flowers with those which
grow in their native dells or woods. Wild shrubs, wild flowers,
wild climbers, can be transplanted to situations quite like their own.
There can be ferneries and rockeries, beds of violets and wild
evergreens, and combined with careless grace, such tropical plants
and brilliant annuals as would give the most pleasing effect and
afford a beauty wholly unique.</p>

<span class="hidden">"H</span>OW shall I stock my garden?" is a question often asked
by amateurs. That depends very much on the size,
location and soil of the ground to be furnished. If the
site is elaborate, and the beds to be geometrically laid
out, much skill, artistic taste and generous expenditure is needful to
produce a fine effect. If the flower beds are cut in the lawn a
different classification and arrangement of plants will be needful.
If they consist of long beds bordering a walk, or one bed only, beneath
the front window, there needs to be a grouping of flowers
adapted to the situation. None but the "wild garden" ought to
be stocked hap-hazard style. Arrange always so that there shall be
a succession of flowers during the entire season, for if you devote
a space for those of brief duration, you will by and by have a barren
spot by no means pleasing. The most exposed situations ought,
of course, to be arranged with special reference to the best possible
effects or continuity of bloom and harmony of colors. Don't mix
in all sorts of colors and sizes of plants in any bed. Masses of
distinctive colors always have a fine effect. Where there are varieties
that have more show of flowers than of leaves, it is well to
intersperse plants whose beauty lies more in their foliage than in
blossoms.</p>

<p>The beautiful Coleuses, Achyranthes and Alternanthera, with
their richly colored leaves, and Pyrethrums with their vivid green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
lancelated foliage, are very effective for this purpose. Cannas are
very fine among tall, free blooming plants, particularly for centers.
Care ought always to be had in selections, so that a tall and coarse
plant shall never have for its surroundings the low and delicate
growers. Imagine the effect of a gorgeous California Sunflower or
a towering Hollyhock in the midst of a bed of Pansies, or Tea
Roses, or a Dahlia in a bed of Verbenas! Have your large stocky
plants in a bed by themselves, unless it be as a background border
for the more delicate flowers. A long bed running beside a fence,
or one beneath the windows of a dwelling-house, can have, with good
effect, a dense background of shrubs or Pompone Dahlias, or even
the taller Dahlias, if relieved by a fence. Where there is a large
bed directly beneath the front windows, a good arrangement is to
have, first, trailing vines that shall cover far up the sides of the
dwelling. For this, the Ipom&oelig;as are very appropriate; of these
there are numerous varieties. <i>I. Bona Nox</i>, with its large fragrant
blossoms, which however, expand in the evening; Mexicana <i>Grandiflora
Alba</i>, immense flowers of white, long tube, a native of Mexico;
grows to the height of ten feet. <i>I. Hederacea Superba</i> is bright blue,
with white margin, Ivy-like foliage, and <i>I. Fol Mormoratis</i>, a new
Japanese variety, with foliage beautifully mottled and marbled with
white; <i>Coccinea</i>, or "Star" Ipomea bears a great profusion of small
flowers, scarlet striped with white. With any of these, vines of the
Canary Bird Flower intermingled, would have a superb effect; the
light green, deeply lacinated leaves and bright, yellow fringed flowers,
proving a marked contrast to the foliage and blossoms of the
Ipomea. It is a very rapid grower, and will climb and branch out
ten feet or more. In front of these climbers, or whatever others
may be preferred, a row of Sweet Peas, quite thickly set, can be
trained so as to fully cover the vines below the flowering branches,
and to conceal the unsightliness of these low down, a row of
Pyrethrums or some dwarf compact plants would be attractive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Then a walk, if the bed is sufficiently wide. The plants on the
opposite side can be arranged so as to have those of medium height
next to the path, and low bedding ones for the foreground. Verbenas
are very fine for this, and so is the Double Portulaca. For
an edging, many things are appropriate; whether one desires
merely a low green, or a border of dwarf blooming plants. For
the latter, we know of nothing prettier than the new dwarf Candytuft,
Tom Thumb. Its habit is low and bushy, and its clusters of
white blossoms continue a very long time.</p>

<p>Mr. Vick has for several years recommended Thrift as the best
edging plant for northern climates. It is easily propagated from
cuttings; every piece will make a plant, if taken in the fall or
spring, and is perfectly hardy. It bears tiny clusters of pink flowers,
and the foliage is fine for floral work.</p>

<p>In arranging your garden stock study the adaptions of your plants
to certain positions. Some require for their best development, a
great deal of sunshine, others require somewhat sheltered positions.
Portulacas revel in dry and sunny spots, laughing at drought, while
Pansies love a cool and moist situation, therefore to bed them in a
sandy soil, and a position where they would be exposed to the intense
sunshine of mid-day, and the Portulaca in the sheltered,
moist situation would be a great mistake.</p>

<p>Coleuses ought not to be set in a very open sunny place, but
with plants that will serve as a protection somewhat, or they will
lose their vivid markings. We observed this first with C. Shah;
when exposed to a strong light, the rich, velvety maroon changed
to a dull color hue, but when partially shaded it was of a very deep,
rich color. The next summer we had the beautiful Pictus, and its
leaves looked as though they were indeed painted with yellow,
brown and green, but exposed for a time to the direct sunshine
nearly all day, it changed to a dark green, with brown markings, and,
robbed of its gold, it possessed no special beauty. We speak only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
of our own experience, which has not been limited by any means
to these two varieties. We have had a few that would retain their
distinctive markings well, even in quite an exposed situation.</p>

<p>In the arrangement of your garden, have it adapted to its surroundings.
The broad leaved Palms, the Tropical Caladiums, the
stately Cannas, the Cape Jessamine and Crape Myrtle are in perfect
harmony with the well kept lawn and stately mansion, but quite out
of place in the simple border of a vegetable garden, or rough grass-plot
belonging to a low, plain cottage.</p>

<p>I will tell you of a bit of a garden furnished in harmony with its
surroundings. It was rudely dug and roughly finished by two very
small hands. It was a very wee bed, indeed. It was fenced on the
west side by a rough board shed; on the north by an old stump;
the other side and end had no protection. Without any method of
arrangement, or reference to artistic effects, here was massed the
following assortment: Monks Hood, Bachelors Buttons, Butter
and Eggs, Star of Bethlehem, Poppies and Marigolds; these last
more odorous than fragrant. Old fashioned flowers truly.
But they harmonized with their surroundings, and the little pale
faced child thought them very beautiful.</p>

<p>It is not essential to harmony however, that the flower bed be
rudely prepared, though the cot be lowly and its surroundings
rough; the garden, however small, can be neatly prepared, provided
there are stronger and older hands than those of the little maid
referred to, and there may be a display of taste in the arrangement
of the most common flowers, in our day at least, where beautiful
varieties are within reach of all. But it was not so fifty years ago;
boxes of flower seeds were not to be found in the shops; catalogues
were not scattered broadcast like autumn leaves and as free; "a
greenhouse at your door," was not then, as now, a verity. School
girls exchanged their limited floral treasures, and now and then a
slip could be begged from the fortunate possessor of a few house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
plants. But if greenhouse flowers were rare, there were thousands
in the meadows, on the hills, in the woods; the sweet May flowers,
unknown then to the little maiden as the Trailing Arbutus, the
Anemone, Hepatica, Columbine, Violets of different hues, Wild
Roses, Gay Lilies, and late in autumn, the lovely fringed Gentian:</p>

<span class="i0">"Each chalice molded in divinest grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Each brimmed with pure, intense and perfect blue."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>What could be more lovely among the garnered treasures of the
greenhouse? But our talk is a long one, and we will defer to
another what we have further to say on this subject.</p>

<span class="hidden">T</span>HIS is one of the most desirable of our annuals, coming into
bloom early in the season and continuing in flower till
frost. They are very effective in massed colors, and make
fine ribbon beds. Contrasting shades should be selected.
A writer in the <i>Garden</i> says that the following are very desirable
for this purpose: "Phlox Lothair, salmon shaded with violet; Mons
Henrique, brilliant reddish crimson; Venus, pure white; Mons
Goldenschugh, rosy violet; Spenceri, dark rosy lilac. An excellent
front edging for this ribbon bed is the variegated Periwinkle.
In order to grow them thoroughly well, and so to insure a
lengthened period of blooming, the ground should be deeply trenched
and well enriched with good manure from the farm yard, and not
more than six heads of bloom should be allowed to each plant. Thus
treated, when planted in long lines, it is difficult to convey an impression
of these and similar varieties."</p>

<p>There are many beautiful varieties of color; deep blood purple,
brilliant scarlet, large blue with white eye, not truly a blue, but the
nearest approach to it of any; Leopoldii, splendid deep pink, with
white eye; Carmine Queen and Violet with a large white eye;
Vick's <i>New Double White</i>, the only one that is reliable, from seed,
to produce double flowers. Then there are the buffs and the stripes,
crimson striped with white, and rose and purple. Mr. Vick, who
makes a specialty of the Drummondii Phlox, they being a favorite
with him, devotes acres to their cultivation, and who has been experimenting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
with them for several years, has produced several new
sorts that are very fine; one of them is deep red with a fringed
edge. There have been very marked improvements since this plant
was first discovered in Texas by Mr. Drummond, a botanical collector
sent out by the Glasgow Botanical Society, and it was one of the last,
if not the very last, sent to Europe by him. He soon after went
to Cuba, where he died of a fever in the prime of life. Sir N. J.
Hooker named the plant after its discoverer as a memento. When
first discovered it was very inferior to the flowers seen in our gardens,
as is very apparent from an engraving of it taken from a
drawing in Mr. Vick's possession, which was made in 1838, three
years after its discovery. It is given in <i>Vick's Magazine</i> for September,
1880, with the items we have cited. The word Phlox signifies
flame, and is supposed to have been applied in allusion to the
flame-like form of the bud.</p>

<p>A lady who had excellent success with her seedlings, started
early in a box, and bedded out one cloudy day in May, says: "I
was surprised to find flowers on the plants when so young and
small. I don't believe they had been transplanted five days before
half of them had flowers, and soon the rest followed, and for more
than two months my bed has been glorious&mdash;a mass of bright colors
more beautiful than any carpet or dress pattern ever made. It is
near the middle of September, and if the frost will only keep away,
it looks as though they would keep on flowering for years. Tell
everybody to have a Phlox bed and how to do it. It is the cheapest
pleasure possible."</p>

<h3><a id="VERBENAS"></a>VERBENAS.</h3>

<p>This we must have, for it is one of the most beautiful annuals
cultivated. So varied its hues! So abundant its blooms! Not a
brief season of flowering, and then naught but leaves, which are,
not of themselves attractive, but an increase of blossoms from June<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
till October, and it requires quite a severe frost to mar their beauty.
They have the best effect massing each color by itself, and beds
of a circular form cut in the lawn and filled with Verbenas, have a
superb effect. Seedlings are much the best for bedding out, they
are so much stronger and more bushy. Those plants offered for
sale in pots, having one tall slender stem, crowned with a cluster of
flowers, are almost worthless for the garden. True, if you get a
healthy one, by layering and pegging down, you can sometimes get
good plants, but you had better purchase seedlings by the dozen as
they are offered in boxes and baskets, or order them of the florist
by mail or express, and you will have plants that will grow compact,
bloom early and profusely, with far better foliage than the puny
straggling ones rooted from cuttings. One objection to purchasing
seedlings by the clump is, I am well aware, the fact that they are
not labeled as to color, and everybody wants to know that they will
have at least one scarlet, one white, purple, and so on, and unless
the color is peeping through the bud, one must buy with the risk
of not knowing the desired color. This is the true state of the
case so far as my own observation extends. But it need not be so,
and we presume it is not so everywhere. Seedlings can be raised
of course with each of the leading colors separate, and those in
greatest demand in large quantities to meet the wants of the general
public, while the fancy sorts can be of mixed varieties. Those
who raise their own seedlings, usually buy a paper of mixed sorts,
so in that case they are no better off than those who purchase seedlings
of the florist, and as their facilities are far greater for raising
early plants, it seems preferable as a general thing, to buy of them,
for these reasons. In order to have good sizable plants for bedding
out in May and June that will bloom in August, seed must be sown
the first of March, at the latest, for it takes weeks for the little dry
sticks to germinate, and then they are such slow growers, unless
under the most favorable circumstances, they do not become strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
vigorous plants by the time you want to bed them out. Few can
care for them properly while their sunny windows are full of choice
house plants, so that as a rule, we should deem it preferable to wait
until May, and then purchase the large budded seedlings, which so
quickly unfold their beautiful flowers to brighten the garden, when
it is almost barren of bloom. They do not cost usually more than
sixty cents per dozen, and one is saved from so much care.</p>

<p>However, for the benefit of those who prefer to sow their own
seed, we will give directions for the best method. First, be sure that
the seed is new. Don't sow old seed for it will not germinate. If
you have no hot bed, make one in a box or pan by putting in a
layer of quite fresh horse manure for bottom heat; over this a
layer of coarse sand; then fill the box with finely sifted soil, mixed
with at least one-third fine sand. Make it smooth; then in little
rows drop the seeds, not very sparsely, for all may not germinate,
and if too thick when they come up they can be thinned out.
Press the seed down with a bit of flat board, sift a little soil over
them and then dampen by light spraying with tepid water; a brush
dipped in water makes a gentle sprayer. Cover with paper, glass,
or what is better, a bit of soft flannel wrung out of water laid on
the surface, as it keeps the soil damp without sprinkling, by being
wet as it dries. The soil must be kept moist, not soaking wet, for
however helpful to germination a previous soaking may be, when
sown the seed must not be drenched, and the same rules are equally
applicable to the seedlings, for in either case rot would surely follow.
It is just here where the special care is requisite to insure
success. After the plants have come up, the flannel or paper must
be removed and the seedlings given sunshine and air, though it is
well to have a glass over the top of the box for a week or more, as
more moisture is thereby secured; but there ought to be an aperture
for the admission of air. When two or more leaves are
developed, it is well to prick them out into other boxes or pots, if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
are too thick for free growth; not all, a part can remain undisturbed.
They should be gradually hardened as a preparation for out-door
life, by being placed in cool situations. While heat is essential to
start the seed into growth, it is not beneficial to the plants, and
those who have a cold frame had better remove the plants to it as
soon as the temperature will admit.</p>

<p>In bedding out, an open situation is preferable. The ground
should be well dug and enriched, with well-decomposed manure,
and if the soil is heavy a liberal mixture of sand. A situation
where the morning sun will not strike them before the dew is off in
the morning is best, as this is one cause of the mildew or rust
which so frequently saps the vitality of the leaves. In order to
promote their spreading, it is a good plan to fasten down some of
the branches when sufficiently flexible to the ground, and for this,
nothing is more convenient than hair-pins. All the seed vessels
should be pricked off in order to secure the best results, as much
of the strength of the plant goes to them if allowed to remain.
One can afford to be very liberal in gathering the flowers, for the
more liberally they are picked off, the more rapidly buds form and
develop. As it was with one of Bunyan's characters:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There was a man (though some did count him mad),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The more he cast away, the more he had."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The wise man says: "There is that scattereth and yet increaseth."</p>

<p>A florist says that "to grow Verbenas successfully, plant them in
beds cut in the turf. Chop the turf well and thoroughly mix with
it a good share of well-decomposed stable manure; never, on any
account plant them in old and worn-out garden soil as they will
most assuredly fail. Give them a change of soil each season, as
they do not thrive well two years in the same bed."</p>

<p>As a house plant the Verbena is not a success. It is most always
sickly, and infested with red spiders. They cannot be kept
over winter in a cellar; it is growth or death.</p>

<p>Verbenas were first introduced into Europe about fifty years ago
from South America, and a few years later into this country. They
have been greatly improved, and the varieties are very numerous.
Many are fragrant. The only hardy sort is Montana, a native of
Colorado. It is a profuse bloomer, color, a bright rose. There are
the German Hybrids, the Italian stripes, and the Drummondii
from Texas. Every year brings its novelties, as with other flowers.
Mr. C. E. Allen, who makes a specialty of seedling Verbenas, is
sending out several fine ones this season; Silver Queen, Florence,
Emma, Carroll, Ralph and Variegata are very attractive according
to the descriptions.</p>

<p>Few things in the garden will
make more show throughout the entire
season, even after quite severe
frosts, than a bed of Petunias from
a paper of seed marked "Choicest
Mixed from Show Flowers." They
will produce such a profusion of
flowers, charming one from day to
day with their variations of markings,
and of color. Some retain
their distinctive characteristics, while
with others they are changeful as
the Kaleidoscope. Stripes, blotches,
sprays, white throats, green edges,
they are just lovely. Then there are the double sorts; purple with
white spots, white with purple; rose color, white, purplish-crimson
margined with white; lilac veined with purple; white with
stripes of purple in the center of each petal, some exquisitely
fringed; large and full as a rose, and some almost as sweet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>In nothing, perhaps, has there been such a wonderful improvement
by culture and hybridising as the Petunia. Mr. Vick tells us
how that half a century ago, he saw for the first time, a Petunia.
It was a novelty&mdash;a strange flower from a flowery land, South
America, and it was carefully treated in green-houses. The flower
was white and small, and looked somewhat as if made of paper&mdash;such
a flower as would now be destroyed if by chance seen growing
accidentally in our gardens. The novelty soon subsided,
and although it was ascertained that it could be grown in gardens,
it did not possess sufficient merit to gain popular favor. A little
later, however, about 1831, to the astonishment of the floral
world, it was announced that a new Petunia, of a purple color, had
been discovered in Buenos Ayres. It was first flowered and seeded
in the Botanic Gardens of Glasgow, and thence seed was sent all
over Europe and to America, where it soon became a great favorite.
About thirty years ago a double Petunia was grown and propagated
by cuttings. It was only semi-double and white, but it was
the commencement of a new era in Petunia culture. Truly wonderful
have been the advances in development of this beautiful
flower.</p>

<p>The Petunia is divided into three distinct classes, the Grandiflora,
Small Flowered and Double.</p>

<p>The Grandiflora varieties have a strong succulent growth, the
flowers are not so numerous as some others, but are very large and
double, frequently measuring three inches in diameter, and some
kinds are exquisitely marked with various shades of violet, purple,
maroon and scarlet upon white ground; some striped, others bordered,
some marbled, some deeply fringed. The double Petunia
gives no seed, and it is only by fertilizing single flowers with the
pollen of the double that seed can be obtained. But Petunias of
all kinds are easily multiplied by cuttings.</p>

<p>The Small Flowered class are those that make our gardens so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
attractive with their varied hues and markings. Some of the new
hybrids are of wonderful beauty. Last year gave two of the Double
and Fringed sort that have been frequently noted as gems of the
first water.</p>

<p>Mrs. Edward Roby, color, a glowing crimson-maroon, edged with
pure white, very double and deeply fringed. Model of Perfection,
deep maroon, heavily edged with white, and deeply fringed. These
were priced last year in a Western catalogue at $1.50 each;
this year they are priced at 30 cents. So one gains by waiting a
year for high-priced novelties.</p>

<p>New Double Fringed Petunia for 1881, is President Garfield,
which originated with Mr. C. E. Allen, and is thus described in his
catalogue: "Color, light purple veined with deep purple magenta,
edged with a broad band of an exquisite shade of green. Very
novel in its appearance and a new color in double petunias; flower
very large and deeply fringed. Plants strong and vigorous; one of
the finest sorts ever offered." For a Petunia so unique as this,
with its broad band of green, and now offered for the first time;
its price, 75 cents, is low.</p>

<span class="hidden">I</span> FIND my Pansies are coming up finely. My bed of Pansies
last year from "choicest mixed seed" sown in April,
began to bloom in June, and afforded me so much pleasure
with their varied beauty, that I resolved this year to
have a great many of them. I see, now that the snow has melted
from the bed, that the plants have wintered well. I had all of the
colors shown in the chromo plate of my catalogue, excepting <i>Emperor
William</i>, dark blue. I think that somebody else must have
got him, for my packet of seed was divided and sub-divided. <i>King
of the Blacks</i> was rightly named, a mere dot of yellow in the center,
and <i>Pure White</i> was in striking contrast, while <i>Pure Yellow</i>
was golden, and <i>Odier</i> was splendid with its dark center banded
with yellow and scarlet. Then there was copper-colored and
striped, and such rich purples with a dot of yellow. How lovely
they were! They were not very large at first, but in August after
a rain, I had superb specimens. They were bedded beneath a fruit
tree, where they were sheltered from the noonday glare. They
thrive best in a moist, partially shaded situation. The blossoms
ought to be picked as they fade, for if left to seed the strength is
taken from the plants and the blossoms are smaller.</p>

<p>This season I have sown musical Pansies. "Musical Pansies!
what are they? What sort of music do they make? Will it be of
the Brass Band order, or that of the hand-organ style?"</p>

<p>No, no! Not that coarse, harsh, loud sort at all. If you could
hear their low, sweet notes, you would be enraptured. But this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
cannot be. I call them musical, because named for the great composers,
Mozart, Handel, Schiller, Goethe, Beethoven, Haydn, Mendelssohn,
and Schumann. They are the "New German Pansies,"
of which types are given in oil colors, in the catalogue of B. F. Bliss
&amp; Sons, and represent the most beautiful strains I have ever seen.
They are no fancy sketch, but drawn as true to life in color and
size as it was possible to make them, if we will accept the testimony
of Dr. Thurber in the <i>American Agriculturist</i>. He says,
that "no doubt many who have seen the colored plate published by
Messrs. B. F. Bliss &amp; Sons, have supposed that the artist had exercised
his imagination both as to size and the strange combinations
of colors. So far from this being the case, the flowers are, if anything,
rather below the real size, and as to colors, it would be impossible
to conceive of any artificial colors more brilliant, or more
strongly contrasted, than they are in flowers, produced by this
remarkable strain of seeds."</p>

<p>In my childhood I knew nothing of the Pansy. The little Heartsease
or Ladies' Delight, as it was then called, was alone cultivated.
Mr. Vick tells us how it grew to be the fine flower now so highly
prized. About sixty years ago, a very young English lady living
on the banks of the Thames, had a little flower garden of her own,
and one bed she filled with Pansies, selecting from her father's
grounds the finest she could obtain. The gardener, seeing her interest
and success, became ambitious to try his hand, and grew
plants from the finest specimens. These attracted the attention of
professional florists, and speedily the Pansy became a popular
flower. Every country gives it a pet name&mdash;Heartsease, Fringed
Violet, Trinity Flower, Butterfly flower, and Johnny-jump-up, while
the French call it <i>Pensée</i>, from which our name of Pansy is probably
derived. It means to remember or keep in mind. A floral
work published in 1732, illustrates it with a colored plate, which
shows it to have been then small like the Ladies' Delight.</p>

<h3>
<a id="MODE_OF_CULTURE">MODE OF CULTURE.</a>
</h3>

<p>For summer blooming plants sow seed in the house, in March or
April. Cigar boxes are very suitable for seed sowing. Put in a
layer of coarse sand for drainage, then one of horse manure for
bottom heat. Fill with rich, mellow earth sifted and mixed with
one-third silver sand, or finely pulverized leaf mold. Have it moist
but not drenched. With a narrow strip of board, make tiny furrows
about one and a half inches apart, and in these carefully drop
the seed one by one an inch distant. Cover slightly, and press
the soil firmly, then lay a piece of old soft flannel folded once or
twice, and wrung lightly out of warm water, carefully over the soil,
which will keep it damp. Cover with glass, and keep in a warm
place. In a few days see if the covering is dry, if so damp it again,
and watch for the seedlings. When they appear, remove the flannel,
but still keep on the glass, not, however, so close as to exclude
all air. Gradually inure them to the sunlight, and as soon as they
have made four or five leaves, it is best to transplant every other
one, so that they may have room to grow. Great care is needful
with tender seedlings to keep them from damping off. If too wet,
they will do this, or if kept too shady. Good judgment is essential
for success. As the weather becomes warm, expose them at
first an hour or two, to the outdoor air, and thus prepare them for
early bedding out. Being hardy plants, living out of doors during
the winter, with slight protection at the North, they will bear
transplanting sooner than many other seedlings. A rich moist
soil, and somewhat cool and shaded situation, are best adapted for
their growth. For winter flowers, sow seed the last of August, or
first of September, in a frame or boxes kept in a shady place.</p>


<h3><a id="ASTERS">ASTERS.</a></h3>

<p>These must be included among the essential annuals for the
garden. They are one of the chief attractions of the border in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
autumn, when many flowers have passed their prime. This plant,
like the Petunia, has in skillful hands and by hybridization, developed
from a very inferior flower to one of great beauty and numerous
classes, which embrace a great many varieties. They are represented
by <i>Dwarfs</i> and by <i>Giants</i>, ranging intermediately from
five or six inches in height to two feet. <i>Dwarf Bouquet</i> presents
a mass of flowers with scarcely a leaf, while <i>Tall Chrysanthemum</i>
grows to the height of two feet, and the <i>New Victoria</i>, <i>Giant Emperor</i>,
<i>Truffant's Perfection</i> and the <i>New Washington</i> bear immense
flowers of great beauty. The last named bears the largest flowers
of any variety; sometimes they measure more than five inches
across. The <i>New Rose</i> is of a strong habit, and the petals of its
large blossoms are finely imbricated. <i>Truffant's Fiery Scarlet</i> and
<i>Dwarf Fiery Scarlet</i>, are a novelty in color among Asters. <i>Goliath</i>
is of a bushy form, and its flowers are very large. Fine colors.
<i>Victoria</i> is a dwarf; snow-white, very double. The <i>Crown Asters</i>
have white centers surrounded with various bright colors, and are
very pretty. The <i>Quilled Asters</i> are quite distinct in character,
the petals consisting of tubes or quills with outer blossom petals
slightly reflexed. <i>Newest Shakespeare</i> and <i>Diamond</i> and <i>Meteor</i>
are novelties of recent introduction, and come in numerous colors.
We grew them last year and deem them admirable.</p>

<p>The native country of this plant is China, hence it has been
called frequently China Aster. It had originally only a few rows
of petals and a large disk. It was first discovered about a century
and a half ago, by a missionary, and sent to Europe. It was first
cultivated in France, and the French florists have done the most
toward perfecting the flat-petaled Aster, and this style of flower is
known as the French Aster. On the other hand the Germans
have sought to produce fine flowers with tubular petals, and the
quilled are therefore called German Asters. Within a few years,
however, the Germans have rivaled the French in originating superior
varieties of the flat-petaled style.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>When first cultivated in France it was called <i>Reine Marguerite</i>,
meaning Queen Daisy; afterward in England it was called <i>China
Aster</i>, which means China Star.</p>

<p>Asters require a rich, deep soil. Twelve inches apart is a very
good distance for the large varieties, the dwarf can be set about six
inches, or even less will do. The tall kinds need to be staked, or
they are liable to be blown down, or prostrated by heavy rains. Do
not tie one string around the entire plant, but use several, and confine
a few branches with each, so that, while having sufficient support,
they may retain their natural position.</p>


<h3><a id="BALSAMS">BALSAMS.</a></h3>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_036.jpg" alt="Balsams" height="300" width="213" />
</div>

<p>Have been sowing my Balsams to-day
in a box, so as to have nice seedlings
to bed out in six weeks from
now. My Balsams last year were superior
to any I had seen, but Mr. J. L.
Childs, who rather prides himself on
his plants, has sent me several packages
for trial. He says: "My stock
of Balsams is undoubtedly the finest
in the world; all who saw them flowering
the past season were astonished
at their size and magnificence. The
new variety (Child's Camellia Flowered
Perfection), is indeed a great acquisition; its flowers are of gigantic
size, and so double and perfect that they resemble small
Camellias; it is also a very free bloomer. I have counted five and
six hundred perfect flowers upon a plant at the same time." That
is a wonderful yield, truly; I cannot expect so many, but half that
number would satisfy me. The Camellia Flowered Perfection
comes in nine colors; pink, scarlet, striped white and purple, mottled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
white and delicate pink, magenta spotted with white, crimson
spotted with white, purple spotted with white, pure white, and
rose-flowered perfection, lavender color, buds when half open, resemble
a rosebud.</p>

<p>I shall sow some of the seeds in June, for autumn blooming, and
shall try more fully than last year the pruning method. This is
done by removing all of the branches, and then the main stock will
grow two or three feet in height, and be a perfect wreath of blossoms.
Another method is to remove the leader and let two or
three branches remain. The flowers are larger, and the plant
handsomer than when allowed to grow at its own sweet will.
They do best in a light, rich soil, and a liberal supply of liquid
manure will greatly advance their growth. A writer in the <i>Gardener's
Chronicle</i> says: "Considering the very effective display that
these plants make when associated with stately foliage plants in
sub-tropical beds, I think they are worthy of more extended cultivation.
There are few plants better adapted for the above purpose
than the Balsam, being easily raised from seed, and as is well
known, they are rapid growers if they are planted in a rich soil.
Several samples of these plants with us are now three feet through
and over two feet high, and they work admirably with such things
as Castor Oils, Cannas, and the beautifully striped Japonica. The
plants referred to were planted out early in June, and I am so
pleased with their behaviour in the sub-tropical garden, that I intend
to grow them largely another year."</p>

<p>I know of no reason why the Balsam might not with good cultivation
thrive as well here as in England. Let us try our "level
best," and see what we can do.</p>

<p><img src="images/i_038b.jpg" class="dropcap" alt="M" title="M" height="95" width="74" />
<span class="hidden">M</span>Y interest in this class of plants was specially awakened
four years ago by the successful cultivation of a dozen
or more new varieties which I was induced to send for by
the reception of the catalogue of the "Innisfallen Green
houses," containing a more attractive list of geraniums, and at
lower prices than I had ever seen. I secured a Club by a little
effort, and thus obtained so many fine extras, that it was a very
agreeable surprise. I have since learned that very many others
have had a similar surprise.</p>

<p>The next spring I had a much larger assortment, and last year
the greatest variety I ever saw. I am sure that I had sixty kinds
in bloom at once. Although very small plants, as they always are
when many are ordered by mail, they throve wonderfully, and with
one exception, were all in flower in a few weeks, and kept on
blooming till after removal in the autumn.</p>

<p>My method of treatment is the following: On opening the boxes
I find them packed in damp moss, many closely tied together. I
take off the oiled paper, loosen the moss packed around them, and
put them in a shallow pan, in which is sufficient tepid water to
cover the roots. After an hour or two I set them in three and four
inch pots, first putting a bit of crock over the hole in the bottom
of the pot, so as to keep the roots from going astray, then some of
the coarse siftings of soil, or small bits of coal for drainage. As
geraniums are not at all fastidious about soil, I take whatever is
available, mix a small quantity of sand with it to make it friable,
enriching with old manure. I nearly fill the pot, and then make a
hole in the center, set in the plant, press the earth firmly around it,
fill to the top and press down again, water, and set the pot in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a><br /><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
cool and shady place for several days, then bring to the light for a
few hours, gradually accustoming them to the sunshine, until they
become fully established in their new quarters. When the weather
is sufficiently warm, I plunge the pots in the border for the summer,
covering the pots entirely. I choose a cloudy day if possible;
if otherwise, I do the work late in the afternoon, so that the intense
sunshine may not at the first beat upon them. I prefer massing
these new plants by themselves, as the effect is more pleasing than
when intermixed with other kinds. The geranium bed is the most
attractive one of my garden. It is always full of bloom, and the
varied hues commingled are very attractive. I remove all decayed
leaves, and the trusses as soon as the flowers have faded. Frequently
there will be a few decayed pips marring the beauty of a
fine truss, and these I carefully remove. All of my large stock
geraniums which have been wintered two years, I set by themselves,
and they furnish an abundance of flowers for bouquets, and
cuttings for new plants. Where one has a plenty of garden room,
they need not mind having several choice geraniums of a kind.
Slips will root well during the summer months, if set in the earth
near the parent stock, where they are shaded from the direct rays
of the sun. Care must be had to set the cuttings well down in the
soil, and firm the earth compactly around them. In this way one
can obtain with little care nice plants for the winter window garden,
which will be more shapely than those which have become
very branchy. Geraniums are ill growing plants unless pruned and
trained with skill. But they are so easily cultured, adapting themselves
to most any situation whether of shade or sunshine, are so
hardy, and bloom so freely, that we can but admire them though
they yield no fragrant flowers. There are many varieties of scented
leaved geraniums, and these mixed with the odorless blossoms
are almost an equivalent. Then the beautiful "Golden Bronzed
Zoned" geraniums, and the "Silver Margined" and "Tricolored,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
are so beautiful in foliage, while <i>Happy Thought</i>, with its creamy
yellow leaf margined with green; <i>Distinction</i>, with deep green
leaves zoned with black; Mrs. Pollock with bronze red zone belted
with bright crimson margined with golden yellow, are exceedingly
ornamental. Beside these there are many perhaps equally attractive,
not often named in the general collection. <i>Freak of
Nature</i>, first sent out last year, is an improvement on Happy
Thought the center of pure white narrowly margined with light
green; flowers light scarlet; habit very dwarf and spreading. It
originated with Mr. Gray of England, and was awarded three first
class certificates.</p>

<p class="caption">BISHOP WOOD GERANIUM.</p>
</div>

<p>Of the numerous classes into which geraniums are divided, few
only are given usually by florists. There are the Ornamental Foliage
of which we have cited a few examples, and the Golden Tricolors,
Silver Tricolors, Golden Bronze, Nosegay and Lilliputian
Zonale; Double and single Geraniums.</p>

<p>We will specify a few varieties worthy of special note, as we can
testify by personal observation. Bishop Wood, Madam Baltet, C.
H. Wagner, Madam Thibaut, Victor Hugo, Jean Dolfus, Cassimer
Perier, John Fennely, Naomi and Rose d'Amour, all double sorts.
Of the single, Dr. John Denny possesses a rare beauty, and is thus
described by an English writer: "Dr. John Denny, raised by J.
Sisley, has quite set at rest the probability of a blue or a purple,
which is a positive fact, and great honor is due to its distinguished
raiser. It also possesses another novel and distinct feature. The
base of the two top petals is of a bright crimson tinted with orange,
which gives it a most striking appearance; this, together with its
immense sized trusses, free growth and shape of blooms, renders it
one of the best for pot or house decoration, and is of great acquisition."
Jean Dolfus belongs to this purple magenta class, a double
geranium, very beautiful. Also Zuleika, which has larger pips and
trusses. It is a little more striking in color than John Denny,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
but both are just as lovely as a geranium can possibly be. When
Jealousy was sent out, there was much ado over it because it was
the nearest approach toward a yellow Zonal, but it was eclipsed
pretty soon by Guinea, which was an advance by a shade or two.
We had the two in proximity last summer, and though but little
difference, it was sufficiently marked to enable us to decide that
Guinea for color, size and form, was preferable. We just get settled
down on that, when we are startled by the announcement of
another novelty, "New Guinea" by name, "a great improvement
on Guinea, being two shades brighter." Well, well! we must have
that, too, and see if in other respects as well as color, it is worthy
to eclipse our favorite.</p>

<p>Henry Cannell&mdash;this is a new geranium, originating with Mr.
John Thorp of Queens, New York, who makes a specialty of seedling
geraniums, and has sent out from his grounds many of great
value, one of them Happy Thought, so widely known. We have
not tested H. Cannell, ours was sent from Innisfallen during the
winter, and has not yet bloomed, but we are sure that it would
never have received the name of the most distinguished florist in
England, if it were not a superior variety.</p>

<p>New Life originated with Mr. H. Cannell of Swanley England,
in our Centennial year, and he sent out the first thousand by subscription
only, at £1 each&mdash;not one sold till the thousand were engaged!
When introduced the following year to this country, stock
plants were sold for $5.00 each. Now you can purchase it at prices
ranging from ten cents to thirty. It is unique in color, being
splashed, striped, and flecked with salmon and white on an intense
scarlet ground. It is sometimes freakish, having pips with some
petals salmon, others partly white and partly scarlet, others pure
scarlet. But this very freak is charming, for with beautifully striped
trusses there will be others thus sportive. Its habit is dwarf, compact,
and its dark leaves zoned with black are very handsome. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
cannot be surpassed as a free bloomer. Mr. Cannell, when sending
it out, expressed the wish that the day might come when there
would not be a cottage in the land where New Life was not found.
John Fennely, salmon striped with white, and Fairy, flaked and
striped with crimson on a bluish white ground, are very pretty.
Dazzle, Harry King, Richard Dean, and Jean Sisley are scarlet
with white eye. Of several single white geraniums in my garden,
I gave decided preference to Madame Quinet.</p>

<p>There is a great difference in the duration of the flowers. Victor
Hugo, a splendid geranium, retains its beautiful trusses full
five weeks. Bishop Wood is also admirable in this respect, and
Jenny Dolfus and Naomi we believe cannot be surpassed.</p>

</div>

<p>Of the Sweet Scented Geraniums,
we have none equal to the
hybrid, Mrs. Taylor, for beauty of
foliage and of flower. It is a fine
grower, and for green to mix with
flowers it is admirable. Dr. Livingstone,
a more recent novelty, is
very handsome and fragrant. Rose
and Lemon scented are delicious.
Lady Plymouth is a variegated
rose; leaves bronzy green, fringed
with creamy white, sometimes assuming
a pink tinge; very ornamental.
London Blue is a very rare variety of scented geranium,
of heavy creeping growth, with large crimped or curled leaves covered
thickly with fine spines or hairs. Seldom blooms.</p>

<p>We have specified a goodly number, yet but a few from the
many, and we can assure you that if you have a large bed of geraniums
you will greatly admire them, and feel satisfied that you have
the most effective bedding plants, requiring the least care, and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the smallest outlay, that you could possibly obtain. In California
they grow without culture to an enormous size. From an editor's
notes we cite the following:</p>

<p>"A little slip of geranium planted out in the spring, had grown
in the summer to 150 branches, its stalk at its base four inches
thick, and bearing over a thousand blooms! I saw a fence fifteen
feet high, sixty-five feet long, covered with geranium vines that had
clambered up one side, and then dropped down the other, filling
both sides with a blanket of scarlet blossoms. It grows like weeds,
and needs no care."</p>

<p>Geraniums are so hardy that one can leave them to the last in
removing from the border in autumn. Frosts that kill Dahlia tops,
and many other plants, do not harm geraniums. Some of mine,
for lack of time to remove, are exposed till late without harm. The
roots have great vitality, and when the stalk has frozen and rotted
to the ground, a new growth will start forth, sometimes in a few
weeks, and sometimes not for three months. I have had this
proved by plants in my window boxes. So one need not be in a
hurry to pull up the frozen geraniums. My large stocky plants I
pack in dry goods boxes, filling in earth around the roots, and put
them in the cellar where they have little light. The pot plants,
also, are mostly put away so as to give all the available room to the
cuttings rooted in the summer, and the rare and tender plants that
will not live in a cellar. These cuttings make fine plants for bedding
out in May or June.</p>

<p>In the spring the large geraniums are brought up to the open
air and trimmed of their dead leaves, pruned of dead branches, and
put in a large bed with the Hybrid Perpetual Roses.</p>

<span class="hidden">M</span>Y first Begonia was a Rex.
It thrived for several
years, and then to my
regret died, for it was
quite a favorite with me. Its large
leaves with broad silvery belt and
red dots, were very handsome.
This species thrive best in a Wardian case and are of rare beauty
and size, grown under such circumstances. A cool, moist atmosphere
is the best for them; they burn and shrivel exposed to the
intense sunlight. They are easily multiplied from the leaves. Cut
the leaf so that a small portion of the stem will remain, insert this
in a pan of damp sand, laying the leaf out flat upon the sand, upper
side uppermost. It can be retained in place by bits of stone or
small pegs. Cuts must then be made in a number of places so as
to sever the veins, thus checking the flow of sap. A callus then
forms at the base of each piece of vein where severed, and just
above it, a bud starts out, and thus a new plant is formed. It is
essential for success, that there should be bottom heat, and that
the air should be moist. A bell glass is the best to put over the
leaf, and if there is danger that the air become too moist, the glass
can be tilted up to allow of an escape. The leaves best adapted
for propagation are those neither very young nor very old, but
healthy and vigorous; yet that this is not absolutely essential is
shown by the experience of a lady who had excellent success with
a leaf that was some what decayed around the edges, and for that
reason was cut off and thrown away. Remembering afterward
that the plant was sometimes grown from pieces of a leaf, she hunted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
it up, trimmed off the decayed portion, and planted it at the
foot of a tree, about half under ground, and pressed the soil firmly
around it. A few months afterward she had a nice little plant
from it, with its beautiful leaves unfolding finely.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_045b.jpg" alt="Begonia" height="250" width="362" />
</div>

<p>There are many varieties of the Rex family; some have brilliant
colors in their leaves, others are thickly covered with short hairs.
These are more difficult to manage, and require great care to preserve
from dust, as like all rough leaved plants, they do not enjoy
spraying, as do smooth leaved ones. It is well to set them out in
a mild shower occasionally. Tepid water is the best for watering.</p>


<h3><a id="BEGONIAS_NOT_REX"></a>BEGONIAS, NOT REX.</h3>

<p>This class are the most generally cultivated, and they embrace a
great many varieties, which are specially distinguishable by the
diversity of their leaves. Most of them are one-sided, that is, they
are larger on one side of the mid-rib than on the other. Some
have fern-like foliage, others lobated. Some have large palmate
leaves, others are spotted and laced with white. As a class they
are very beautiful for their foliage, but when to this attraction is
added beauty of flowers, it will be seen at once that they are eminently
deserving of the prominent position now given them both in
the open border and the window garden.</p>

<p>We will name for the benefit of amateurs some of the most desirable
as given by Mr. Vick: <i>Fuchsioides</i>, with its drooping scarlet
flowers, is one of the most desirable of the whole class; the
leaves are small, and of a dark green color, and the small, delicate
brilliant flowers are produced in great profusion. As a winter
blooming sort it is indispensable. <i>F. Alba</i> bears white flowers.
<i>Richardsonii</i>, a variety with white flowers and deeply cleft palmate
leaves, requires more heat than the former, therefore well adapted
to our warm rooms. <i>Subpeltata nigricans</i> has large, dark purple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
leaves, and bears clusters of large rosy flowers, very ornamental.
<i>Grandiflora rosea</i>, with light pink flowers, and <i>Sandersonii</i>, scarlet
flowers; <i>Weltoniensis</i>, of dwarf habit and small dark green foliage,
rich pink flowers, are all fine winter bloomers. <i>Argyrostigma picta</i>
has long, thick leaves, with white spots. <i>Metallica</i>, an elegant
plant with bronzy green foliage, and producing an abundance of
pale peach-colored flowers, is of very recent introduction. <i>Louis
Schwatzer</i> has a beautiful marked foliage in the style of Rex, dwarf
habit. <i>Mons. Victor Lamoine</i>, leaves marbled like lace. <i>Glaucophylla
Scandens</i> is of quite recent introduction, and the very best
of all for a hanging basket. It is of a drooping habit, and its
bright glossy leaves are very handsome. It bears large panicles
of orange salmon flowers.</p>


<h3><a id="TUBEROUS_ROOTED_BEGONIA"></a>TUBEROUS ROOTED BEGONIA.</h3>

<p>This is a class of quite recent origin, and differs from the more
general varieties, in that it has bulbous roots which can be
taken up and stored during the winter like Gladioli and Gloxinia
bulbs. It has larger flowers than the other species; red, orange,
yellow, with intermediate tints. A writer in the London <i>Garden</i>
says of them:</p>

<p>"The bulbous Begonias, mostly of the Boliviniensis and Veitchi
sections or families, may have also a brilliant future in the flower
garden. Meanwhile, their proper place seems to be in the conservatory,
greenhouse and window garden. For such positions it is
well-nigh impossible to match the bulbous-rooted Begonias for brilliancy,
grandeur and grace, three qualities seldom combined in the
same plant. The plants are also characterized by great distinctness
and freshness of style and character."</p>

<p>They are both double and single. Of the single flowered, the
most important sent out last year was <i>Davisii</i>. It is a native of
the Andes of Peru. Dwarf in habit, the leaves and flowers all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
springing from the root stalk. "The scapes which rise erect above
an elegant bluish green foliage, are light red; each scape bears
three dazzling scarlet flowers. The plant is of very free growth,
and a profuse bloomer." <i>Frobelii</i>, a new species from Ecuador,
said to be very attractive, producing, well above the foliage, erect
branches of large brilliant scarlet flowers; the foliage is of bright
green, furnished on the under side with a thick covering of white
hairs. <i>White Queen</i>, a very elegant variety with numerous racemes
of ivory white blossoms.</p>

<p>Of the new double flowered, <i>Glorie de Nancy</i> is represented as a
magnificent variety, with large very double carmine flowers, and
very floriferous. <i>Louis Van Houtte</i>, flowers large, of a crimson
scarlet color; of fine habit, and a free bloomer.</p>

<p>"<i>Comtesse Horace Choeteau</i>, is an inch or more in diameter, very
double, and of a delicate, soft shade of rose; the young plant in a
three-inch pot presented a number of flowers and buds, indicating
a good blooming habit. As a double flower it is remarkably fine,
the petals being well formed, pretty smoothly laid and imbricated."&mdash;<i>James
Vick.</i></p>

<p>The soil best adapted for Begonias is turfy loam, leaf-mold, sand,
and old well-rotted manure in equal parts. When growing, they
require a liberal supply of water, applied directly to the soil.</p>

<p>The Begonias are natives of the tropical countries of Asia,
Africa, and America, and most of them inhabit the mountainous
regions at a considerable elevation. They were first brought to
notice and introduced into cultivation about two hundred years ago
by a French naval officer, Michel Begon, from whom they derived
their name.</p>


<h3><a id="GLOXINIA"></a>GLOXINIA.</h3>

<p>This bulbous plant is a native of the tropical region of South
America, and deserves a more general culture, for all the varieties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of this genus are very handsome, <i>magnificent</i> is not too strong a
term to apply to many of them. They may be raised from seed by
sowing early in spring in a finely sifted soil of leaf mold and garden
loam. But great care is needful, and then one has to wait the following
year for the flowers. It is better to obtain the bulbs in the
spring all started, then they will bloom during the summer. Mine
had several leaves, and I removed them from the thumb pots to
five-inch size, which I judged would be sufficiently large for them.
They need plenty of light and heat and plenty of air. To prolong
the flowering an occasional watering with manure water should be
given. In the autumn they must be gradually dried off and the
bulbs kept in a warm, dry place, secure from frost. They can be
potted any time from February to May. The bulb must be planted
so that its top will be level with the surface of the soil, and watered
sparingly until the leaves appear.</p>

<p>I will describe a few "superlatively beautiful." <i>Cinderella</i>, pure
white with pink band. <i>Brilliant</i>, bright crimson, margined with
rose, rich violet throat. <i>Rose d'Amour</i>, rose carmine, cream colored
throat, zone of cerise. <i>Nero</i>, dark purple, white throat.
<i>Princess Royal</i>, tube and edges white, throat mottled with dark
blue. <i>Lamartine</i>, very beautifully undulated, magnificent shape;
white bordered rose limb, veering to cochineal, marbled with white
and elegantly veined with rose. <i>Boule de Neige</i>, pure snowy
white, an abundant bloomer. These are only a few selections from
the many, but sufficient to give you an idea of the variety of colors.</p>


<h3><a id="TUBEROSE"></a>TUBEROSE.</h3>

<p>What flower can be whiter, sweeter, and more lovely than the
Tuberose? As the flowering bulbs can be bought for ten and fifteen
cents, according to size, no one need be without this charming
flower. It is a native of the East Indies, and was introduced into
Europe more than two hundred years ago. Until recently Italy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
grew the tubers for Europe and America, but it has now been discovered
that American grown tuberoses are superior in quality to
the imported, and many florists of Europe now advertise them.</p>

<p>Here is a description of the tuberose, which appeared originally
in a volume entitled "<i>The Flower Garden Displayed</i>," published in
England in 1732:</p>

<p>"This is a bulbous root, brought to us from Italy every year. It
brings a spike of white flowers on the top of a stalk about three
feet high, and is very sweet scented. The flower buds are a little
tinted with a lake or carmine color. We raise this by planting the
roots in pots of fine earth, and plunging them in hot beds in February
or March; but give them no water till they sprout, then we
have this flower in July. Or else set the roots in a warm border
under a south wall, and they will some of them flower in August
and some in September, or this month or the next. When these
blossom you may pot them and set them into the green-house, and
some will even bloom in December."</p>

<p>Mr. Vick, from whose magazine we quote the foregoing, gives an
engraving copied from the work, showing the character of the tuberose
as it was nearly a century and a half ago. It represents a
small single flower, that would be lightly esteemed by us.</p>

<p>The flower stalk is from three to five feet in height, and bears
from twenty-five to eighty blossoms. The <i>Pearl</i> is much the finest
sort. When the bulbs are obtained from the florist they have usually
several little tubers round the large one. These ought to be
taken off and placed in rich, mellow soil to the depth of four or five
inches. They must be cared for by keeping the earth loose and
watering occasionally. Before frost they should be lifted, their tops
cut away, and then kept in a dry, warm place during the winter.
The strongest ones will usually blossom in the autumn. But summer
flowering bulbs are so cheap it seems scarcely worth the
trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Will Tuberoses flower the second year, is a question frequently
asked, and usually answered in the negative, even by popular florists.
A writer in an English periodical, <i>Gardeners' Chronicle</i>,
gives the following facts:</p>

<p>"Last year, instead of throwing away all our plants when they
had done flowering, as is, I believe, customary, I saved back twelve
plants, not picked ones, which were placed under a stage in a late
vinery, where they remained until the end of April without receiving
any water to the roots, other than what they derived from the
moisture of the house, by which time most of them had thrown up
their flower-spikes, which proceeded from young tubers, formed
immediately upon the top or crown of the old ones, and from the
union of which&mdash;when the plants had received a thorough watering,
and otherwise were subject to a growing temperature&mdash;a profusion
of roots emanated, after which the plants received a suitable
shift to a small 24. The spikes of these plants, although not so
strong or fine as those produced by tubers imported last autumn,
are nevertheless good, both in spike and each individual flower,
which, moreover, expanded in the most satisfactory manner possible,
so much so, that this and other seasons I intend to save all my
tuberoses for flowering the second year, and perhaps the third. I
may here remark for the information of the uninitiated in tuberose
culture, that in potting the tubers all little bulbets or offsets should
be rubbed off, and subsequently any suckers which may appear
should be removed forthwith, otherwise failure to flower these most
beautifully scented flowers will, in all probability be the result.
The plant is of comparatively easy and simple culture, and considering
the value of the tuberose while in flower, and its great suitability
for bouquet-making, etc., the wonder is that it is not more
extensively cultivated in private establishments as well as by market
gardeners."</p>

<p>A gentleman writes me of a new method with Tuberoses; new to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
him, and he says that in a large range of horticultural reading he
has never seen it mentioned nor heard of its being used except in
the instance he cites. He says: "I have grown Tuberoses for the
past ten years with varying success, but the main difficulty has
been that so long a time has been required in rooting and stocking
them that the first frost finds a large proportion of them just budding,
or not commenced to spindle. Had tried various places, hot-bed,
furnace-room and hot-house, and all the early spring months
and December, but that made no difference; they would not start
until they got ready, and I lost many bulbs from rotting. Two
years ago, a friend who had had a similar experience surprised me
by showing me plants about the first of May with fine tops that
had been planted but three weeks, and the first of June had stalks
a foot high, while my bulbs which had been planted the first of
February, did not commence to sprout until June, although they
had been in a hot-house under favorable conditions.</p>

<p>"Now the reason simply was this: He had taken his bulbs and
not only pulled off all the small ones attached, but had dug out
with a sharp knife all the small eyes, and had cut off the whole of
the tuberous part, leaving only the bulb proper. This I tried on
one-half my bulbs, with the result that they were nearly two months
earlier than those planted the same time, that I did not cut. Although
this seems to be rather severe treatment of the bulb, it has
given such good results that I propose to continue the practice."</p>

<p>My own experience is that of late blooming. Of the dozen I
planted in the border in June, five were finely budded when taken
up in September, and have since bloomed. Two others had just
begun to spindle, the others with one exception look as though
they would not stalk. Next year I purpose to try this new method.</p>

<span class="hidden">I</span>T was my intention to devote this entire article
to "Ornamental Foliage Plants," but I think
I will have a prelude, and my prelude may
have no more connection with my "talk"
proper than Mr. Cook's preludes do with his lecture
proper, and I think that frequently the first is the
most interesting and important; and from the fact
that in the published reports much more space is
afforded to the prelude than the lecture, I opine that
others are of the same opinion. "The Topic of the
Hour," whatever may be the question just then stirring
the public mind, is usually chosen as the preface.
The topic of the hour to-day has been a bit of a sermon
from the text, "And to every seed its own body,"
and the lesson embodied was that of Faith. The preaching came
from a package of gladiolus bulbs, just received, and it run on this
wise:</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_053b.jpg" alt="Gladiolus" height="300" width="91" />
</div>

<p>Here are these dry bulbs, separately wrapped and labeled.
They look alike in color, and very nearly alike in form; some are
rather more cone shaped than others. One is larger and more flat.
But there is nothing in form nor size to show that they will not
develop precisely the same form and color of flower. I know that
they will all reveal the leaf, habit of growth, bud and bloom that
distinguishes this species of plant from all others, because I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
that these are gladiolus bulbs, and every seed hath its own body.
A gladiolus bulb never yet produced a dahlia. A tigridia or shell-flower
bulb, though greatly resembling some gladiolus bulbs, and
its form of leaf is very similar, yet it never produces a bud nor
blossom like the gladiolus. The tigridia hath "its own body,"
peculiarly and exclusively its own. I have spoken thus far of demonstrated
facts&mdash;facts that have become to me a matter of personal
knowledge.</p>

<p>But now comes the lesson of <i>Faith</i>. I find each bulb bears a
different name. I take my catalogue and read the description
against the name on each label. Thus I am told what colors pertain
to each bulb, inclosed, shut up beyond my ken. Do I have
any doubts respecting these descriptions&mdash;that the distinguishing
characteristics of each sort before me will fail to correspond? Here
is <i>Lord Byron</i> and <i>Lord Raglan</i>. How do I know that the former
will be a brilliant scarlet, stained and ribboned with pure white,
while the latter will have salmon colored blossoms, spotted with
scarlet and blotched with dark garnet? I do not <i>know</i> this, for I
have never seen it demonstrated, but I have an <i>assured faith</i> that
in due time I shall behold those flowers true to their assigned
colors, and if there should be a failure I should attribute it to the
mistake of the labeler.</p>

<p>But why should these brown bulbs, so alike to outward view,
bear flowers so widely differing in hues? Why should <i>Cleopatra</i>
have a large flower of soft lilac tinged with violet, and a purple
feathered blotch, while <i>Meteor</i> is dark red with pure white stain?
Why should <i>Nestor</i> be yellow striped with red, and <i>Addison</i> dark
amaranth, with white stripes? Vainly would I seek by dissection
to fathom the mystery of these hidden diversified markings, but He
who created this plant of wondrous beauty gave to each "seed its
own body," and thus we can plant in faith&mdash;yea in full assurance
of faith&mdash;that in due time our eyes will behold all those varied tints<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
now secreted in these bulbs before us. Our seed sowing is all the
work of Faith, and Hope looks beyond with bright anticipations of
the summer and autumn harvest.</p>

<p>The gladiolus is very easily cultured, and I have far better success
in keeping the bulbs through the winter than I have with the
dahlia. The tubers of the dahlia easily rot, on account of the
dampness of the cellar, though carefully dried and packed in sand.
But the gladiolus bulbs, without any special care, come out in fine
condition. I like to add a few new ones to my old standard stock,
so as to have a variety of colors, for few flowers make such a grand
display in the flower garden, and the spikes of bloom are admirable
for bouquets, as the buds will unfold day after day for a long time.
The lower flowers on the stalk can be removed as they fade. The
flowers are very fine also for saucer or shoal dish bouquets. I have
a special liking for these. Fill the shallow dish with water or sand&mdash;I
prefer the latter kept constantly wet&mdash;then arrange tastefully
short stemmed flowers till they are a mass of bloom. I first make
a green border of geranium leaves, or some trailing vine. Different
shades of gladiolus flowers picked from the stalk are very effective
to set off the flowers not so striking. Where the season for out-door
culture is short, as it is here in Maine, it is best to get the
bulbs started in the house. Some do this by simply placing them
in a sunny window without covering. I always plant mine in a
box.</p>

<p>The gladiolus can be raised from seed, but they are of slow
growth, and one has to wait till the third summer usually for their
flowering. It is far better to purchase the bulbs, then they bloom
the first season, and, except some of the rare sorts, multiply rapidly.
Although novelties, and some rare sorts are very expensive, $1.50,
$2 and $3 for a single bulb, yet very fine bulbs of choice colors can
be obtained for that price <i>per dozen</i>. In reply to the question,
"What are the names of six of your finest gladiolus not very expensive?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the reply is, "Calypso, Cleopatra, Agatha, Eldorado, James
Carter and Lord Byron." These six cost but little more than $1.
Of those more expensive the following are very desirable: Addison,
Eugene Scribe, Etenard, La France, Meyerbeer and Rossini. These
cost a little less than $3. Unnamed bulbs, a good variety, can be
bought for $1 per dozen of reliable florists.</p>

<p>Of the new varieties sent out the present season for the first
time, are the following raised during the past year by M. Souchet,
M. Leomine and other French growers, who have for years made
the improvement of the gladiolus a special study. They are said
to be superior to any gladiolus hitherto introduced. Aurore, Bremontier,
Chameleon, Corinne, Dalila, Eclair, Gulliver, Hermione, Lesseps,
Tolma, Victor Jacquemont. The descriptions represent them
as superb, and they ought to be at the price named, $4 per bulb!
Some of us will have to wait till their novelty is worn off.</p>


<h3>NEW HYBRID GLADIOLUS.</h3>

<p><i>Lemoinei</i> and <i>Marie Lemoine</i>. "These two varieties are Hybrids
of gladiolus purpureo-auratus, and are of the old garden varieties
of Gandavensis, and are now offered for the first time. In form
they approach the old Gladiolus Biperatus, the colors being creamy
ground with distinct markings of crimson-maroon, with lemon and
salmon colored cloudings. They have proved quite hardy and may
be left out of doors from year to year." Mr. Henry Cannell of
Swanley, England, a florist of world-wide reputation, says of those
hardy Hybrids: "It is considered both by professionals and the
trade, that M. Leomine's greatest victory was in crossing Gladiolus
purpureo-auratus and gandavensis, two distinct species, and at the
time they were awarded first-class certificates, it was thought by
many that some higher and substantial recognition ought to have
been made for introducing a perfectly hardy constitution into our
glorious garden gladiolus, and saving the trouble of housing them
from frost every season."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>


<h3>GLADIOLUS PURPUREO-AURATUS.</h3>

<p>This is a new species from Natal, quite distinct from the common
species of gladiolus and very attractive. On a slender, bending
stem, which rises to the height of three or four feet, are borne from
eight to twelve nodding flowers, somewhat bell-shaped in form, and
yellow in color, with broad purple stripes on the lower divisions
within. Its bulbs are small, and at the end of long runners numerous
offsets are produced which are more certain to flower the succeeding
season than are the old bulbs.</p>


<h3>GLADIOLUS GANDAVENSIS.</h3>

<p>This ancient type is a very ordinary flower, and it seems almost
incredible that such superb varieties should have been produced
therefrom by cross-fertilization. In the hands of the French florists
it has attained to the superior position it occupies to-day. More than
forty years ago Mons. Souchet, head gardener at the Château of Fontainebleau,
first called attention to this flower, and began its improvement,
and although some few other French florists, such as
Messrs. Courant, Berger, Lamoine, Verdier and others followed his
example, yet nearly all of the varieties now in commerce in France,
are of the raising of that now venerable and respected private citizen.
His successors, Messrs. Soulliard and Brunelet supply the
great French houses of Paris, by whom the bulbs are forwarded to
all parts of the world. About thirty years ago Mr. Kelway of Longport,
in Somersetshire, began his culture and hybridizing of the
flower, and has built up an immense business. He devotes fifteen
acres to Gladiolus exclusively, and the number of seedlings annually
raised is 200,000. In 1879-80, Mr. Kelway exhibited eighteen
named seedlings which were severally awarded first-class certificates
as possessing striking original characteristics. Of our own eminently
successful growers, Messrs. Hallock and Thorp of Queens,
N. Y., take the lead. They devote over seven acres to Gladiolus,
and raise thousands of seedlings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>


<h3>MODE OF CULTURE.</h3>

<p>For diversity of color and general effect, either in masses, or in
beds of three or four rows, placing the bulbs one foot apart and
three inches deep. Mix a liberal supply of well-rotted manure
with the soil, and if clayey, use sand. As soon as the plants are sufficiently
tall stake them, and mulch with dressing.</p>

<span class="hidden">H</span>ERE we step on disputed ground. Are Geraniums Pelargoniums?
Who shall decide when florists disagree? There
are eminent names on both sides of the question. Mr.
Henry Cannell of Swanley, England, a florist who stands
in the front rank, and whose name has become so widely known
in connection with <i>New Life</i> Geranium, of which he was the originator,
jumbles up together under the head of Pelargoniums everything
we on this side of the water class under the head of Geraniums.
A veritable muddle he makes of the matter&mdash;that is our
private opinion&mdash;we whisper it to you confidentially. Here is our
yellow Zonal <i>Guinea;</i> our best scarlet bedder, <i>Gen. Grant</i>, and
<i>Wellington</i>, and <i>Mrs. Pollock</i>, and <i>Happy Thought</i>, all called Pelargoniums,
and yet are quite unlike in leaf and flower what we
Americans denominate a Pelargonium; and, to avoid confusion, it
is certainly advisable for us to adhere to our established distinctiveness.
We quote from the <i>Gardener's Chronicle</i> of January 3d,
1880, a sensible talk on this subject, to which Mr. Cannell takes
exceptions: "Pelargoniums and Geraniums&mdash;I think it would be
as well to settle by authority the exact names of those flowers that
seem to be indiscriminately called Pelargoniums and Geraniums.
Botany has been described as the 'science of giving polysyllabic
barbarian Greek names to foreign weeds;' but while some plants,
Abies Mariesii for instance, are most carefully described, others, as
Geraniums, seem to be called by names that do not belong to them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
but to quite a different flower. I notice, both in your letter-press
and advertisement, mention made of Zonal Pelargoniums; now I
should certainly decline to receive Geraniums if I ordered Pelargoniums.
I am old enough to remember that we had a parti-colored
green-house flower of a violet shape that was called a Geranium,
then came a lot of hardy-bedding-out stuff with a truss of
red flowers, all of one color, followed by <i>Tom Thumbs</i> and <i>Horseshoes</i>
which grow nicely out of door. Then we were told that we must
no longer call those green-house plants <i>Geraniums</i>, that their right
and proper name was Pelargoniums, and that those bedding-out
plants were, strictly speaking, Geraniums. Now, however, the old
name Geranium seems to be dropped for both, and the new name
Pelargonium given to both, surely erroneously! Let us, however,
have it fairly settled which is which, so that we may clearly and
distinctly know what we are talking about, and not make mistakes
either in writing or talking, in sending to shows, or in ordering
plants."&mdash;<i>James Richard Haig, Blair Hill, Sterling.</i></p>

<p>We will now give a part of a lecture delivered last spring before
a Pelargonium Society in London, by Shirley Hibberd, a delightful
writer on Horticulture, says Mr. Vick, from whose magazine we
quote the following:</p>

<p>"A Pelargonium is not a Geranium, although often so called.
The true Geraniums are for the most part herbaceous plants inhabiting
the northern hemisphere, and the Pelargoniums are for the
most part shrubby or sub-shrubby plants of the southern hemisphere.
Let us for a moment wander among the pleasant slopes
of Darley dale in Derbyshire, or by the banks of the Clyde or the
Calder. We shall in either case be rewarded by seeing vast sheets
of the lovely meadow Crane's Bill, Geranium pratense, a true Geranium,
and one of the sweetest flowers in the world. In the rocky
recesses of Ashwood Dale, or on the banks of the 'bonny Doon,'
we may chance to see in high summer a profusion of the Herb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Robert, Geranium Robertianum, with pink flowers and purple
leaves, a piece of true vegetable jewelry. And, once more, I invite
you to an imaginary journey, and we will ride by rail from Furness
to Whitehaven, in order to behold on the railway bank, more especially
near St. Bees, a wonderful display of the crimson Crane's
Bill, Geranium sanguineum, which from July to September, forms
solid sheets, often of a furlong in length, of the most resplendent
color. No garden coloring can even so much as suggest the power
of this plant as it appears at a few places on the Cumberland coast;
even the sheets of scarlet poppies we see on badly cultivated corn
lands are as nothing compared with these masses of one of the
most common and hardiest of our wild flowers.</p>

<p>"Now let us fly to the other side of the globe and alight in the
vicinity of the Cape of Good Hope, say on the vast desert of Karroo,
where there is much sand, much sunshine, and little rain. Here,
in the midst of desolation, the world is rich with flowers, for the
healthy shrub that occurs in patches, glowing with many bright
hues, consists in part of wild Pelargoniums, which often take the
form of miniature deciduous trees, although in the valleys, nearer
the coast, where more rain falls, they are evergreen bushes.</p>

<p>"Very different in their character are these two tribes of plants,
and they are not less different in their constitution and aspects.
We may regard the Geraniums as herbs of Europe, and the Pelargoniums
as miniature trees of Africa. When we examine the
flowers, we find the fine petals of a true Geranium of precisely the
same shape and size; but the fine petals of a Pelargonium are not
so, for sometimes the topmost are the largest, and stand apart from
the rest with great dignity, like mother and father looking down on
their dutiful daughters, and in other cases they are the smallest,
suggesting that the daughters have grown too fast and become unmanageable.
The florists are doing their utmost to obliterate the
irregularity of the petals of the Pelargonium, and in this respect to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
convert Pelargoniums into Geraniums, but the conversion will not
be complete until much more wonderful things are accomplished.
A Geranium has ten stamens, and a Pelargonium has only seven
(perfect ones). These numbers are not constant, but the exceptions
are of no consequence in a general statement of the case.</p>

<p>"When all is said that can be said about the differences and resemblances
of the several genera of Geraniaceæ, there remains only
one constant and unfailing test of a true Pelargonium, and that is
the nectariferous tube immediately below the flower, and running
down one side of the flower-stalk. If you hold the pedicel up to
the light, it may be discerned as giving an indication of a double
flower-stalk, but when dissected with a pin or the point of a knife,
it is found to proceed from the base of the largest of the green
sepals, and it often appears to form a sort of digit or point in the
line of the pedicel. When you have mastered this part of the
story, you may cherish the idea that you know something about
Pelargoniums.</p>

<p>"The large flowered show varieties and the large-flowered single
Zonals take the lead, and they are pleasantly followed by a crowd
of ivy-leaved, double-flowered and variegated sorts that are useful
and beautiful. The Pelargonium Society has set up a severe standard
of judging, and a variety must be distinct and good to pass
through the sieve. Moreover the raising of varieties has been to a
great extent reduced to scientific principles, and we obtain as a result
new characters suggestive of the great extent of the field that
still lies open to the adventurous spirit in cross-breeding. No one
in recent years has contributed more directly toward the scientific
treatment of the subject than our own painstaking Treasurer, Dr.
<span class="smcap">Denny</span>, of whose labors I propose to present a hasty sketch.</p>

<p>"Dr. <span class="smcap">Denny</span> commenced the raising of Pelargoniums in the year
1866, having in view to ascertain the influence of parentage, and
thus to establish a rule for the selection of varieties for seed-bearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
purposes. In raising varieties with variegated leaves, as also with
distinct and handsome flowers, he found the pollen parent exercised
the greatest influence on the offspring. The foundation of his
strain of circular-flowered Zonals was obtained by fertilizing the
large starry flowers of Leonidas with pollen taken from the finely
formed flowers of Lord Derby. From 1871 to the present time
Dr. <span class="smcap">Denny</span> has sent out sixty varieties, and he has in the same
period raised and flowered, and destroyed about 30,000. These
figures show that when the selection is severe, and nothing is
allowed to pass that is not of the highest quality, there must be
500 seedlings grown for the chance of obtaining one worth naming."</p>

<p>We have devoted a good deal of space to this citation because of
its interest and value on the question at issue. Mr. Hibberd has,
we think, made the matter very clear, and conclusive it must be to
the most of minds. Pelargoniums are divided into classes, though
we rarely see any classifications of them in the catalogues.</p>


<h3>REGAL PELARGONIUMS</h3>

<p>Are comparatively a new type, and from the fact of their having
more scalloped petals, somewhat approaching a double; they retain
their petals instead of shedding them as do the single show flowers.
The Beauty of Oxton and Queen Victoria, novelties of very recent
introduction, belong to this class. We had them in bloom last year
and thought them very fine. The Beauty of Oxton has the upper
petals of a very rich maroon color, darkly blotched; under petals
very dark crimson, shaded with maroon; light center tinted with
rose. All the petals are attractively and regularly margined with
white and beautifully fringed. The flowers are large and the extra
number of petals gives them the appearance of being semi-double.</p>

<p>Queen Victoria is of a very novel type and marvelously beautiful.
The flowers have crispy petals, all of which are a rich vermilion
in color, broadly margined with white, and the upper ones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
blotched with maroon. The "Show and Fancy Pelargoniums"
have what the florists term "blotches," i.e. large spots on the two
upper petals, and "spots" which mean the darker marks upon the
center of the lower ones. The Lady of the Lake belongs to this
class. Lower petals orange-rose painted with crimson, very dark
maroon top petals with a narrow, even crimson edge, white center.
Prince Charlie is very unique in its markings. Color white elegantly
tipped, with rose-violet blotches.</p>


<h3>FRINGED AND STRIPED PELARGONIUMS.</h3>

<p>This is a very handsome class of which there are many new
varieties. Princess of Wales we had last summer. It has elegant
frilled petal margins; flower trusses large size and borne in profusion
well above the foliage; ground color pure blush, each petal
alike marked with a rich dark velvet crimson-scarlet margined
blotch.</p>

<p>Star of the East resembles the Princess of Wales in growth and
profusion of bloom, but with larger flowers, of pure white ground.
The petals are elegantly fringed, the upper ones marked with a
rich crimson spot, and the under ones elegantly penciled with
violet-colored lines. These are among the novelties of recent introduction.</p>


<h3>HYBRID PERPETUAL PELARGONIUMS.</h3>

<p>A class of distinct habit, free bloomers, mostly fragrant foliage,
good for bedding out. Of these we have only had Madame Glevitsky
of Bavarian origin. Color, upper petals a fine vermilion,
veined and spotted with purple, under petals vermilion.</p>

<p>We were much pleased with Pelargonium Filicifolia Odorata
for its finely cut leaves of a Fern-like appearance and pleasing
fragrance.</p>

<p>Our specimens of the various classes were from the extensive
and superb collection of Mr. John Saul, of Washington, D. C.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Among them was one which originated in his establishment and
was named for his wife. It belongs to the "Regal" class. The
habit is compact and very free flowering, producing large trusses of
flowers the color of which is a rich glowing vermilion, with light
center and light margin to the petals.</p>

<p>We are indebted to Mr. John G. Heinl for specimen plants of
two "New Monthly Pelargoniums," now offered for the first time
to the general public. Of the origin of one, <i>Fred Dorner</i>, we have
this account given in a letter to Mr. Heinl, from Fred Dorner, Esq.,
of Lafayette. Mr. Dorner says:</p>

<p>"Six years ago I undertook to grow some Pelargoniums from
seed. I procured some very choice seed of Ernest Benary of
Erfust. The seedlings grew finely. About midwinter one commenced
to bloom, and to my astonishment kept on blooming for
ten months, during which period it was never without flowers.
The plants grew to a good size and at one time I counted forty-seven
good-sized trusses on it. The winter and everblooming quality,
with the large and beautifully colored flowers, makes this Pelargonium
a great acquisition to the amateur as well as the florist. I
have seen here in Lafayette plants in windows blooming all winter,
and it is acknowledged here to be the best and easiest kept house
and window plant, blooming from nine to ten months in the year."</p>

<p><i>Freddie Heinl</i> originated with Mr. John G. Heinl, who says it is
a sport from <i>Fred Dorner;</i> it is lighter-colored and the flowers are
somewhat larger. That these are both a rare acquisition is evident
from the testimony of such florists as Mr. John Thorp of Queens,
and Mr. Henry A. Dreer of Philadelphia. Mr. Thorp says, "There
are no Pelargoniums equal to them and they have a decided right
to be called perpetual." Three months later he writes: "I am
more than ever impressed with their superiority over any perpetual
blooming varieties, and they must take foremost rank." Mr. Dreer
says: "The Pelargoniums have proven very satisfactory. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
flowered during the greater part of the summer, and are now full
of buds."</p>

<p>The colored lithograph, which Mr. Heinl says is a good representation,
shows them to be very beautiful. We should think that
to call a plant so dissimilar in foliage and flower a Geranium, would
be a misnomer, why not equally such to call a Geranium a Pelargonium?</p>


<h3>MODE OF CULTURE.</h3>

<p>As we have seen by Mr. Hibberd's address, the Pelargonium's
native home is on arid plains where there is much sand, much sunshine
and little rain, so that they are chiefly dependent on heavy
dews for moisture. To plant them in heavy soil, give them a sheltered
situation and liberal and frequent watering, would be a mode
of treatment directly the reverse of what they require. In the cultivation
of all plants we should as far as possible adapt them to
their native conditions. One skilled amateur says his rule is to let
the earth in the pots become thoroughly dry before watering, and
always to give a period of rest after blooming. Another, a lady,
said she never had any success with Pelargoniums until she gave
them a heavy period of rest after blooming. In the spring, when
putting her plants out of doors, she laid the pots containing Pelargoniums
on their sides, and let them remain perfectly dry until fall.
She then took the plants out of the pots, shook the soil from the
roots, and scrubbed them well with a hard brush and water. The
old-looking roots were cut off and the top trimmed down to six or
eight inches in height. They were then repotted in rich earth and
watered very moderately till they started into full growth, and after
that more freely. With this treatment they never fail to bloom.</p>

<p>A young physician who raised many extraordinarily fine varieties
of Pelargoniums from seed, in stating his mode of culture, said that
<i>his</i> practice was to re-pot large plants whenever they seemed in
danger of being pot-bound. The mold he used was made up of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
black earth from under a manure heap, and a little stiff clay to retain
the water. After the plants were done flowering, they were
trimmed rather close, and with regard to probable places of sprouting.
They were then placed in partial shade, and all shoots found
straying out of symmetry were pinched off. His large plants were
kept moist till after bloom, and then rather dry.&mdash;<i>Floral Cabinet.</i></p>

<p>We have given these methods so that if not successful with one,
another can be adopted.</p>

<span class="hidden">T</span>HE Fuchsia was introduced into England in the latter half
of the last century by a sailor, at whose home it was discovered
by Mr. James Lee, a florist of Hammersmith, who
secured the original plant by paying quite a sum of money
for it, and in addition promising to give to the sailor's wife one of
the first young plants he would succeed in raising. In a short time
he succeeded in producing several hundred nice plants, nearly all
of which were sold at a guinea each. Shortly after this a captain
Firth presented one that he had brought from Chili to the Royal
Garden at Kew. The plant was named in honor of Leonard Fuch,
an eminent German Botanist, who lived in the 16th century. The
varieties in cultivation to-day are vast improvements. One of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
early varieties was called <i>Fulgens</i>. We recollect seeing this variety
some four or five years ago, and could not refrain from comparing
it with a number of varieties lately introduced. The flower may
be described as follows: A slender crimson tube two inches in
length; sepals narrow, one-half inch; in color a shade lighter than
the tube; the corolla purple; in size very small compared with the
varieties of the present time. This variety is a strong grower,
large foliage which has a silvery appearance. Thus we can have a
slight idea of that from which have been produced the beauties of
our time; thus can we see what a skillful florist can do when he
has something to begin with. Some of the varieties of the Fuchsia
are hardy in England as well as in some parts of our own country.
A traveler informs us that he has seen them in California trained
over arbors and to the houses just as we train grape vines here,
and growing most luxuriantly. They grow in favor very rapidly
wherever introduced, and it was but a short time after they became
known we find the Poet eulogizing them in these lines&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>While some flowers have been extremely popular for a season,
and then have sunk into comparative obscurity, the popularity of
the Fuchsia has never waned, but on the contrary has continually
been on the increase until now it occupies a prominent place in
every collection of plants, be that collection large or small. There
is a cause for this popularity, and that cause is, it is of easy culture
and produces its flowers freely, often under adverse circumstances.
The Fuchsia is readily propagated by cuttings of the young wood.
These will root in from two to three weeks, when they should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
potted in rich soil, say one-half garden soil or loam enriched with
well-rotted manure, and one-half leaf soil, with a little sand added
to make the compost very porous. From the time the plant is first
potted it should never be allowed to become so dry as that the
growth will be checked. The great secret of growing Fuchsias successfully
is to <i>keep them growing</i>. In order to do this we must
provide for them a rich soil, an abundance of pot-room and a moist
atmosphere. If you wish to grow large specimen plants the cuttings
should be struck (that is rooted), early in the season. This
will allow a longer period for them in which to make their growth
before the season for blooming arrives; by keeping the plants supplied
with plenty of pot-room the time of blooming will be somewhat
retarded, and if on the other hand we desire to have the plants
in bloom as early as possible we allow plenty of pot-room during
the early part of the growing season, after which we allow the pots
to become pretty well filled with roots, and abundance of beautiful
pendulous flowers will be the result.</p>

<p>As house or window plants the Fuchsias are very popular. The
variety <i>Speciosa</i> will bloom very freely during the winter. During
the summer months they should be protected from the direct rays
of the sun, and kept well syringed. As bedding plants their utility
is limited, as they must be planted in a shaded position. A bed of
them in such a position makes a pleasant appearance, and in this
way they are easily kept through the hottest part of the year.
They may be bedded out, or may be allowed to remain in the pots
and the pots plunged in the garden. In this latter way they will
need additional care, as they must not be allowed to suffer for want
of water. If it is desirable to keep the old plants another year they
may be removed to the house or cellar, and kept cool and dry until
toward spring, when they can be repotted in fresh soil, watered
scantily, and started into growth and pruned or trained to any
desired shape or form.&mdash;<i>The Floral World.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>The foregoing article so fully and clearly stated all that was essential
respecting the culture of the Fuchsia, that we have transferred
it entire instead of writing something original. We need now only
add a few things respecting some choice varieties and recent novelties.
"<i>Champion of the World</i> has the largest blooms of any
Fuchsia; the tubes are short; sepals very broad and of great substance,
well reflexed, and of a most beautiful coral red; the foot-stalk
of each bloom is of unusual length and strength, so that each
flower stands out bold and graceful. Corolla of immense size, and
as it expands forms two-thirds of a perfect ball. Color is of the
most intense bright dark purple. Free tall grower, and for conservatory
decoration is one of the most remarkable Fuchsias for
size ever yet sent out."&mdash;<i>H. Cannell.</i></p>

<p>The illustration of this Fuchsia in Mr. Cannell's <i>Floral Guide</i>
measures two and one-third inches in diameter, and yet we are told
that when well grown, the <i>Champion</i> produces much larger bloom
than the engraving. It has four rows of petals, and looks round
and full like a pink. <i>Bland's New Striped</i> is of the single class, but
the corolla is very large, of a rich plum-colored purple, regular and
distinctly striped red and rose, pyramidal shape, habit strong.</p>

<p>Of the Hybrid variegated Fuchsias, <i>Sunray</i> is by far the best
with red variegated leaves ever sent out; it is very ornamental.
<i>Pillar of Gold</i> is a very showy variety with yellow leaves. Among
the novelties in color, we find mention of <i>Aurora Superba;</i> tube
and sepals rich salmon, corolla large and spreading of a distinct
orange scarlet highly suffused with yellow, fine habit and free
bloomer. <i>Polyhymnia</i> is a dwarf yellow.</p>

<p>Of <i>Lord Beaconsfield</i>, Mr. Cannell says: "One of the strongest
and most conspicuous blooming varieties ever sent out, and one of
the very best for sale and decoration; flowers neither good shape
nor color, but produced in very large clusters and blooms nearly all
the year if allowed plenty of root room."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>This Fuchsia originated with Mr. John Laing, Stanstead Park
Nursery, Forest Hill, near London, and is a cross between Fuchsia
Fulgens and one of the modern varieties known as "Perfection."
It was exhibited at some of the meetings of the Royal Horticultural
Society first, as Laing's Hybrid, in 1875 or 1876. It much resembles
the old Speciosa, but is more free blooming even than that, and
its flowers are twice as large.</p>

<p>Kingsburyana, figured in Mr. Cannell's <i>Floral Guide</i>&mdash;which
comes to us from Swanley, England&mdash;is very large and double.
"It is another addition to the double white corolla class, and is
remarkable for its fine vigorous growth and large showy flowers;
its corolla is particularly novel and beautiful."</p>

<p>Mrs. H. Cannell, named for the florist's wife by Swaffield, its originator,
"was one of the greatest lifts in bringing the double white
corolla to perfection," and has given great satisfaction in this
country. We have never seen one so beautiful, but Mr. C. E.
Allen who has a large collection, including those rare gems from
across the water, we have named, says: "<i>Snow White</i> is the very
best double white Fuchsia ever sent out. A fine, erect grower,
and a remarkably free and early bloomer. Sepals coral red. Superior
to Miss Lucy Finnis in that it is of a stronger habit. Have
none now in bloom." Among the fine specimen blooms of the
dark purple type sent us by Mr. Allen, we think <i>Elm City</i> the
gem for size, richness of color&mdash;a double dark purple striped with
scarlet, sepals scarlet-crimson&mdash;and compact form. The <i>Swanley
Gem</i> is of a peculiar shape, single, very open bell-shape corolla,
"frilled" Mr. Cannell calls it, rose color with tube and sepals coral
scarlet, the latter are very prettily reflexed.</p>

<p>We began our list with the <i>Champion</i>&mdash;the largest known&mdash;we
will end it with the tiniest, <i>Microphylla</i>, the whole plant, flowers and
leaves are Liliputian among the Fuchsias.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>


<h3>FUCHSIAS IN THE ISLE OF MAN.</h3>

<p>Here these are truly wonderful; they grow up the house fronts,
and grow into large trees, so large that you can have a tea-party
around the bole of the trees. They are also grown for hedges and
kept nicely clipped, and with their bright green leaves and scarlet
flowers look cheerful and refreshing. The winds and the spray from
the sea do not in the least affect them.&mdash;<i>The Garden.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Vick, in his Magazine says: "Once when in Europe, we saw
at Ventnor, in the Isle of Wight, a Fuchsia tree, perhaps twenty
feet or more in height, with a trunk full fifteen inches in diameter.
The editor of the <i>Flore des Serres</i> of Belgium, in writing of this
tree, says it is doubtless the largest specimen in Europe, but is
only a baby compared with specimens the editor has seen in South
America. Seeing our notice of this tree, Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicholls</span> of Sharon
Springs, N. Y., wrote us that he had "seen Fuchsias in the Isle of
Jersey, in the English Channel, thirty feet in height, and there are
hundreds there from twenty to twenty-five feet."</p>


<h3>PROPAGATING FUCHSIAS.</h3>

<p>We have found the most effective method to be by placing the
cuttings in a bottle of water, and keeping them in a sunny window,
but the following method is said to be practiced by cottagers in the
west of England: "In the autumn, after the frost has destroyed
the foliage, the wood of the present season is cut off close to the
ground and laid like a sheaf of corn in a trench a foot deep. The
bundle is covered with a few inches of soil, and here it remains
until spring, when a multitude of young shoots may be seen pushing
their way through. The soil is then carefully moved, and with
a sharp knife a cut is made each side of a joint, and the result is
rooted plants enough for the parish. The old stool throws up more
vigorously than before, to be served in the same way the following
autumn."</p>

<h3>BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.</h3>

<p><img src="images/i_074b.jpg" class="dropcap" alt="O" title="O" height="95" width="59" />
<span class="hidden">O</span>NLY a few years ago, not one of the Coleus family had a place
in the gardens of Europe and America, and I have been told
that in our absence gardeners depended chiefly upon plants
with showy flowers for ornamenting their gardens and
grounds. When some of my remote relatives were introduced, numerous
were the surmisings as to what place they should occupy
amongst cultivated plants. This was especially so in the case of
Perilla Nankinensis, a plant of most sombre hue, but so striking
withal as to attract general attention. Some looked upon it as the
forerunner of a class of plants destined to play an important part in
the future, whilst others regarded it as a vile weed. Nevertheless,
considerable attention was bestowed upon its cultivation for a time;
but ultimately became so neglected as to be met with chiefly as a garden
weed. This may have been owing in some measure to the introduction
of Coleus Blumei, which species was regarded with greater
favor, and at once took a place which it held fairly well for a time, or
until he whose name I bear obtained from it varieties so novel and
brilliant in color, as to entitle them to rank high amongst the time-honored
favorites of the garden. From the most reliable information,
I infer that this species at least is one of my immediate ancestors,
and whether I owe as much of kinship to any other, has not been
made known. But this I do know, from the day I was first introduced
to the public, in my chocolate and violet colored suit until the present
time, I have been praised as few plants have been. But being
neither envious nor vain, I have desired the company of those
whose colors are brighter than my own, as variety in harmony gives
greater satisfaction than any one can singly bestow. Some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a><br /><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
older varieties are well fitted to produce this effect, and none more
so, perhaps, than my old friends Aurea Marginata, and Golden Circle;
but the majority of their class either lack expression, or are
so delicately constituted as to become perfect "frights" when
planted out of doors.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 294px;">
<img src="images/i_075.jpg" width="294" height="400" alt="DREER'S NEW HYBRID COLEUSES." />
<p class="caption">DREER'S NEW HYBRID COLEUSES.</p>
</div>

<p>During my time, many varieties with excellent characters when
in my company, have performed their parts but poorly, whilst
others have had enough to do to keep up a doubtful reputation. It
was with pleasure, therefore, I hailed the arrival of a fresh set from
England a short time ago, headed by George Bunyard, who, with
his companions were so highly spoken of, that I hoped one or more
of them would prove of service to me. But this hope has not been
realized, and to-day, for all of them, I am as destitute of support as
I was before their arrival. Poor George, after being much in his
company for a season, it is only fair to say, he performed his part
so poorly that I hope, for the credit of both, we shall never meet
again under similar circumstances.</p>

<p>What the incoming season may bring forth, yet remains to be
seen, but at present the prospects are good for a grand display, as
a new order of aspirants are being marshaled for duty, whose merits,
some say, are such as to eclipse the old members of our family,
and even take from me the honors I have enjoyed so long. Should
their claim be well founded, I shall surrender my right to the first
place without regret, and be even glad to take any subordinate
place I may be deemed competent to fill. But should they fail to
meet the expectations thus produced, it will be my duty to remain
at my post until such time as new varieties are found, regarding
whose merits there can be no doubt.</p>

<p>Be it understood that what has been said about my associates
has reference only to them as bedders; for it is well known, many
varieties when grown under glass, and partially shaded from the
glare of sunshine, possess greater brilliancy and beauty than I lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
claim to. For this reason, I think those so constituted as to require
the protection of a green-house, should be sparingly, if at all,
planted out of doors, and the outside department exclusively occupied
by such as attain their greatest perfection in free air and the
full tide of sunlight.</p>

<p>Before closing this monologue, I am forced to say a word in behalf
of a plant seemingly possessed of extraordinary capacity for
the work in which I excel. I refer to Acalypha Macaffeana, the
leaves of which are large and finely formed; color, reddish-brown,
and irregularly blotched with bright shades of crimson. When
fully exposed to sunlight, it looks as if "on fire through all its
length," and being much more stately than myself, might form the
central figure in a group of Coleus or other plants with the greatest
acceptance.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Verschaffeltii</span>, in <i>Gardeners Monthly</i>.</p>

<p>We do not know who is the author of this very interesting autobiography
of an old and popular Coleus. The florist for whom it
was named, M. Nuytans Verschaffelt, was the adopted son of the
late Jean Verschaffelt, of whose nursery near Ghent, he was the
manager, and to which he succeeded on the death of the proprietor.
M. Nuytans was a very distinguished and highly esteemed horticulturist;
he was an active member of the Royal Agricultural and Botanical
Society of Ghent and Chevalier of the Order of Philip the
Magnanimous. He died June, 1880, in the forty-fourth year of
his age.</p>

<p>There has been a remarkable progress in the development of the
Coleus since the introduction of Blumei, but the two past years
have been more distinguished than any previous ones by the originating
of many new and beautiful hybrids. Pre-eminent among
these are "Dreer's Set of Tri-colored Coleus," fifteen varieties;
"Queensland Set," fifteen varieties, and "Queensland Set of Dwarfs,"
ten varieties. Mr. Henry A. Dreer says of them: "These varieties
which it is a pleasure to offer, have originated in our nursery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
grounds during the past summer, were selected from perhaps six
thousand seedlings excelling in point of color, variety, habit and
novelty, and we feel safe in predicting for them a future that leaves
nothing wanting in this class of plants."</p>

<p>Mr. Dreer is sustained in his statement by the verdict of many
of the leading florists who visited them, and the committees of the
Cincinnati, Philadelphia and New York Horticultural Societies, the
summer and autumn before they were offered to the public.</p>

<p>In the February number of the <i>Gardeners Monthly</i>, a lady asks
some of the correspondents who have tried the new Coleuses, to
report thereon, whether as brilliant as their illustrated types, and
if they retain their colors in bedding out. We will give the replies
from the March number.</p>

<p>J. R. H., Richmond, Va., says: "In response to the query of
Mrs. R. B. Edson about Dreer's New Hybrid Coleus, I take pleasure
in giving my experience with regard to their hardiness in the
summer sun. As the summers in our city are extremely dry and
hot, I think it a very fair trial of them.</p>

<p>"When I received my box of Coleus from Mr. Dreer and opened
it, the first thought was that I was swindled nicely, while I at once
perceived that they were of an entirely new type of Coleus, but
considered their colors very ugly indeed, and quite different from
the colored sheet in his catalogue. However, I determined to give
them a trial before expressing my opinion. I put them in the hottest
place I could find, determined to get out of them all the 'come
out,' should there be any, and to my utter surprise, their colors
changed so rapidly and beautifully, that after a lapse of two weeks,
I could scarcely believe they were the same plants. I so much
liked them I determined they should have a prominent place in my
garden, and accordingly planted them in my border where they
did not miss the sun at all while it shone. They grew off at once
with the old colors (as when received), which discouraged me again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
when to my surprise, about the middle of June, they began to show
their bright colors again, and in three weeks they were the brightest
and prettiest Coleuses I have ever seen, and remained so with
a continual growth until they were killed by the frost.</p>

<p>"I must confess I never saw plants resemble as much the colored
plates of their likeness, as did my Coleus; just like the plate with
the exception of the fine gloss, which of course I did not expect.
It seemed that the hotter the atmosphere was the brighter they
looked, and have stood the sun about twenty per cent better than
the older varieties. They have given me more pleasure than any
set of new plants I have ever received. I consider them the greatest
acquisition I have known in the soft-wooded class of plants.
While there is quite a similarity in the tri-colored set, it is not at
all an objection. The only objections to any of them are that
Amabilis and Mrs. E. B. Cooper, while very rank growers, are exceedingly
ugly, and Superbissima entirely worthless. It will not
grow, I don't care what I do with it. Some seedlings that I have
raised from them are very richly colored, and I think them much
prettier than their parents, though I have not had a chance to test
their qualities in the summer."</p>

<p>We regret that the writer did not give the names of those Coleus
he so much admired as well as those which are "exceedingly ugly"
and "entirely worthless." We can report the same lack of success
with Superbissima. It would not grow one bit, but remained stationary
several months, and then died.</p>

<p>Mr. E. L. Koethens reports from a large collection: "For bedding
these are the chosen ones, Gracilliana, Miss R. Kirkpatrick,
Superbissima, and above all, Speciosa. But for inside culture,
many of the new ones are unsurpassed for beauty in any class of
decorative plants. Here again Speciosa and Miss R. Kirkpatrick
of Dreer's set, lay claims to attention, and his Amabilis is attractive
for its free blooming properties. Fairy is also conspicuous, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Beacon takes the place of Superbissima indoors, but Zephyr, in
my opinion crowns them all as a foliage plant for indoor culture;
a single head often measuring ten inches across, with a rich bronzy-brown
color. The above are all valuable acquisitions and should
be in every collection."</p>

<p>Mrs. M. D. Wellcome thus writes: "Mrs. R. B. Edson in her
charming 'Garden Notes and Gossip,' asks that some of the
correspondents who have tried the new Coleus, Dreer's and Henderson's
new sets, report thereon. I have not tried Henderson's, and
only six of Dreer's, so I am not prepared to report very fully.
But I wish to make special mention of Miss Ritta Kirkpatrick,
which looks like the picture only it is handsomer. It is the one
represented by a large leaf, creamy white center, broad, green
lobed margin. It was a wee plant when it came to me in early
spring, but it very rapidly outgrew the other five, branching out
finely, so that I began in June to take slips from it, and have continued
to do this each month to the present time. I should think
I had rooted full thirty cuttings, and the original plant, which has
been beheaded on three of its branches, has now twenty-eight that
would I think all make very nice plants, if treated as were the
others. I rooted them all in sand, kept constantly wet, and exposed
nearly all day to the rays of the sun. I never saw anything so
quickly take root and so rapidly grow as did those cuttings. At
one time I kept half a dozen about two months in the pure sand,
till they were fine large plants, with a great mass of roots. They
can be removed from the sand to pots of earth without retarding
their growth. I always allow the particles which adhere to remain
in transplanting. This Coleus is a special favorite with me. Fairy,
foliage yellow and green, blotched with crimson-scarlet, and Charm,
yellow, tinged with bronzy scarlet, stained with dark brown; green
deeply serrated margin, were very beautiful in the open ground,
and from these I rooted also in sand several very fine cuttings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
But the original plants did not grow rapidly. I think the Coleus
adds much to the attraction of the border, but it is for the winter
window-garden they are specially valuable."</p>

<p>These new Hybrids have stood the test of a year's trial, and
three varieties exhibited at the June meeting of the Royal Horticultural
Society, London, carried off the highest prize for this class
of plants, and received very flattering newspaper notices. In Mr.
Dreer's catalogue for 1881, he has selected twenty-four which
he calls the cream of those New Hybrids. Superbissima is included,
while Zephyr is omitted. Kirkpatrick is among them, we are happy
to say. So superb are some of the recent Coleuses, <a id="TN2">Verschaffeltii</a>,
we fear, will have to retire still further into private life. Being
quite advanced in years, we presume he will not regret this. We
are sure that he will always be treated with that respect which is
due to honorable old age.</p>

<h3>CROTONS.</h3>

<p>Everybody has heard of croton oil, but only a few of that same
everybody know anything about Crotons. The number of species
known is enormous, and they are found in many parts of the world,
but chiefly at the South Sea Islands. Some kinds are native to our
own country, mainly in the South and Southwest, but these are not
characterized by the brilliant markings of the foreign varieties.
Their leaves are often thick and large, but usually they are very
long and narrow and ribbed, veined, spotted and blotched with
crimson, scarlet and gold. They are a very interesting class of
ornamental plants, and their low price, twenty-five to fifty cents,
except for novelties, places them within reach of the common people.
They do best in a rich soil, with a little peat and sand; also
an abundance of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>The specimens I have are these: <i>Aucubæ Folium</i>&mdash;leaves large,
dark green, blotched with golden yellow. <i>Interruptum</i>, very long
leaves, mid-rib bright scarlet, shading to gold&mdash;very graceful. <i>Irregulare</i>,
so named because of the irregularity of its leaves in shape
and color&mdash;two precisely alike being rare.</p>

<p>The handsomest however of my collection, is Croton <i>Weismanni</i>.
The ground color is a shining bright green, striped and mottled
with golden yellow. The leaves grow to a foot in length and three-fourths
of an inch wide. Among the more recent and high priced
novelties are Croton <i>Evansianus</i> and <i>Princess of Wales</i>. The
former is "distinguished by the peculiar form of its trilobate leaves
and the depth of coloring pervading the whole plant. The newest
formed leaves are light olive green with mid-ribs and veins of golden
yellow, and the interspaces spotted with the same color. As the
leaves become older, the green deepens and changes to a bright
bronzy crimson, and the golden yellow of the mid-ribs, veins and
spots becomes a rich orange scarlet." <i>Princess of Wales</i> is one of
the long-leaved drooping forms of Croton, and is very distinct in
character. The leaves are from one and one-half to two feet in
length. The ground color is green, and the variegations creamy-yellow,
very variable in color. The markings are of the maculate
style, with here and there large blotches of clear cream-yellow, and
and in other parts clouded markings of smaller confluent blotches
and spots. Occasionally these conditions are reversed.</p>

<p>The Croton <i>Fenzii</i>, recently offered in commerce by <span class="smcap">M. Solviati</span>,
of Florence, is described as a jewel among the Crotons. It is
the result of a cross effected in the green-houses of Sesto, between
<i>C. Veitchii</i> and <i>C. Weismanni</i>, and has moderate sized oval acuminate
leaves, richly veined with golden yellow, the principal nerves
being purplish-red, which color extends to the stem and the petiole.
The habit is so dwarf and compact that plants only a foot high are
often seen with all their splendor, the yellow streaking then extending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
to almost the whole surface of the leaf, and the red nerves
shining on the yellow ground. It is a variety especially fitted for
the decoration of small green-houses, as it requires very little room
to be able to develop all its charms. This variety has been dedicated
to the Chevalier <span class="smcap">E. O. Fenzi</span>, President of the Royal Horticultural
Society of Tuscany.&mdash;<i>London Florist.</i></p>


<h3>FANCY CALADIUMS.</h3>

<p>Of these the varieties are numerous, and the foliage very ornamental.
Those I have are <i>Dr. Hondley;</i> green ground, blotched
with rose, crimson center; <i>Madame Houllette</i>,&mdash;blush clusters and
white spots on green ground; <i>Sagittæfolium pictum</i>,&mdash;arrow-shaped
leaves prettily spotted with white; <i>Madame Alfred Bleu</i>,&mdash;the
ground color of the leaves is silvery white, which is blotched with
green, in some leaves very sparingly, in others, nearly half the surface;
the veins are prominent and of rich rosy crimson, bordered
by narrow bands of a lighter shade. <i>Alfred Mame</i>,&mdash;beautiful
deep carmine, richly marked with rosy spots and white leaf margin.
<i>La Perle de Brazil</i>,&mdash;ground color, green, reticulated all over with
pure white, like fine lace. These last three are from the collection
of Mr. John Saul of Washington, and are new.</p>

<p>Fancy Caladiums do best in somewhat shaded positions, in well
enriched soil, composed of finely decomposed manure, leaf mold
and sand, and a moist, warm temperature. Great care must be
had in their earliest stage of growth, to prevent decay of the tubers
by over-watering. They can be preserved in sand during the winter,
in a room sufficiently warm to prevent danger from frost.</p>


<h3>CALADIUM ESCULENTUM,</h3>

<p>Is the most striking and grand of the Ornamental Foliage Plants
for the lawn or flower garden. It will grow in any good soil, and
is very easy of cultivation. When of full size it stands about five
feet high, and its immense leaves often measure four feet in length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
by two and a half in breadth; very smooth, of a light green color,
beautifully veined and variegated with dark green. When killed
down by frost in the autumn, the bulbs must be taken up and stored
in the cellar. The Caladium belongs to the family of "Jack in the
Pulpit," or Indian Turnip, and the Ethiopian or Egyptian Calla.
They rarely bloom in our Northern States. The flowers resemble
in shape the Calla Lily, only are much larger and narrower, are of
a rich cream color, very fragrant at first, but soon lose their odor,
which resembles the Magnolia.</p>


<h3>ERANTHEMUMS.</h3>

<p>These comprise a large genus valuable for their foliage and also
winter flowers, yet not very generally cultivated. Mine are labeled
<i>Andersonii</i>, "a handsome orchid-like flower, white, spotted with
red." <i>Pictum</i>, foliage prettily streaked with white, a strong, vigorous
grower; <i>Tricolor</i>, leaves prettily marked with pink and green;
<i>Cooperi</i>, has flowers white, prettily streaked with purple; <i>El Dorado</i>,
light green foliage, with golden veinings.</p>


<h3>MARANTAS.</h3>

<p>These are considered by florists as among the most elegant of
tropical plants, but like the Eranthemums, are not generally known.
They are all natives of tropical America, and require strong heat
with plenty of moisture. They are low-priced, and ought to be
more extensively cultivated. I think mine are very beautiful. <i>Eximia</i>,
upper surface of leaves striped with grayish-white; under,
purplish-violet. <i>Leopordina</i>, pale green with oblong blotches of
deep green. <i>Mikans</i>, shining green with a white feathery stripe.
<i>Van den Heckii</i>, dark glossy leaves, mid-rib silvery white. <i>Makayana</i>,
a very ornamental dwarf species; leaf-stalks slender reddish-purple,
blade of the leaf ovate, ground color, olive green, beautifully
and regularly blotched with creamy yellow of a transparent character;
on each side the mid-rib are oblong dark green blotches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
while the under side is rosy red. <i>Tubispatha</i> is an elegant and
very attractive species of erect habit of growth; leaves some nine
or ten inches long, light green, ornamented on each side the mid-rib
with oblong blotches of cinnamon brown. <i>Veitchii</i>, "The
leaves of this grand plant are upward of twelve inches in length;
the under surface of a rich purplish-wine color, the upper of a deep
shining green, blotched with conspicuous patches along each side,
of a yellowish-green, almost verging on gray. The contrast is very
marked, and the whole plant very beautiful."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Achyranthes</span>, a genus of richly colored tropical plants, are better
known, and to a limited extent are found in many gardens, <i>Verschaffelti</i>,
with its dark crimson leaf, being the most common.
<i>Brilliantissima</i>, ruby red, is a new English variety; <i>Wallisii</i> is a
new dwarf, with small purple leaves; <i>Lindeni Aurea Reticulata</i>,
foliage netted with golden yellow, on a light green ground. These
plants are of the easiest cultivation, and endure strong sunshine
without injury.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alternantheras</span> are also very effective for bedding plants;
habit dwarf. Foliage is in some of a magenta-rose color, others,
yellow and red; <i>Purpurea</i> has a purplish tint, and <i>Versicolor</i>, crimson
and pink shadings. They are unsurpassed for ribbon or carpet
bedding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dieffenbachia</span>, a genus of stove plants with very showy foliage.
<i>Brasiliensis</i>, a handsome variety, the leaves averaging eighteen
inches in length by eight or nine inches in width; the ground
color of the leaf is deep green, and the whole surface is mottled
with small blotches of greenish-yellow and white; <i>Bausei</i> is a
stocky-growing, broad-leaved variety, with yellowish-green leaves,
which are irregularly edged and blotched with dark green, and also
spotted with white, the markings being peculiarly effective; <i>Weirie</i>
is of dwarf habit, the foliage of a bright green color, thickly blotched
and spotted with pale yellow. One of the finest of the species.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
They grow best in loam and peat equal quantities, with a little sand.
Require strong heat and frequent watering.</p>

<p>A few ornamental foliage plants of rare beauty received from
Mr. John Saul merit special notice:</p>

<p><i>Cyanaphyllum Spectandum</i> is a grand plant with large, oblong,
lustrous leaves which have a rich, velvety appearance; they are
beautifully ribbed with whitish color.</p>

<p><i>Alocacia Macrorhiza Variegata</i>, its large caladium-shaped leaves
are marbled and broadly splashed with white. Some leaves are
nearly all white; <i>Zebrina</i>, fine yellow leaf-stalk with distinct black
marks; <i>Illustris</i>, the leaf-stalks are erect, and have a brownish-purple
tint, color a rich green, marked between the principal veins by
broad patches of a blackish olive, and forming a striking contrast
with the brighter green portions of the leaf surface; <i>Sedini</i>, "A
very beautiful hybrid between <i>A. Metallica</i> and <i>A. Lowii</i>. The
form of the leaf is perfectly intermediate between the two parents,
whilst the coloring is a very striking and pleasing combination of
the metallic hue of one parent, with the dark green and prominent
white veins of the other." Alocasias require a moist heat during
their growing season. Soil, peat, with a small portion of loam,
sand and manure.</p>

<p><i>Acalypha Macafeeana</i> is another of the rare and beautiful foliage
plants alluded to. It is considered the best Acalypha ever offered.
It is certainly very handsome with its "sub-cordate and serrate
leaves, eight inches long and six broad, frequently cut into many
forms, and very highly colored bright red, blotched with deep bronzy
crimson." It proves to be an admirable plant for bedding out.
Quite as attractive every way is <i>Panax Laciniatum</i>, "An elegant
and very distinct habited stove plant from the South Sea islands.
The leaves are tinted and indistinctly marked with pale olive brown,
and form a rather complicated mass of narrow segments; they are
bipinnate, nearly as broad as long, and have a drooping contour;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and the pinnules or segments are very variable in size and form,
presenting the appearance of a complex head of foliage in which
the lanceolate lobes or pinnules have the preponderancy."</p>

<p><i>Panax Fruiticosm</i> has a very graceful fern-like foliage. These
plants belong to the Aralia family, a genus very ornamental, natives
of the South Sea Islands.</p>

<p>Another of my Washington collection, very graceful and beautiful,
is <i>Paulinia Thalictrifolia</i>. Its delicate cut leaves resemble the
fronds of a finely divided Maiden-hair Fern. The leaves are of a
rich shade of green. The young shoots and foliage are of a pinkish-brown
color. It is of slender growth and climbing habit, very
similar to Capsidium Filicifolium, which has long been a special
favorite of mine. Both of these are elegant, trained on a pot trellis.</p>

<p>Paulinia Thalictrifolia is a native of the southern Brazils, from
whence it was introduced to the nurseries of Messrs. Veitch &amp;
Sons of Chelsea. If only required for decorative purposes there
should be no inclination to make the plants produce flowers which
are inconspicuous; therefore the main object should be to have
plenty of healthy foliage. To secure this, the plant should be
grown in a temperature of from 65° to 70°, and if one part of the
greenhouse is more adapted to its growth than another, it is the
dampest part. After this plant came into the possession of Messrs.
Veitch, and before its true value became known, some plants of it
were placed in a corner of an old, very damp, warm pit, in which
position they grew wonderfully strong, and quite surpassed in vigor
and beauty those that were, as was then supposed, placed under
more advantageous circumstances, i.e., in dryer and lighter parts
of other houses. Care is therefore now taken to keep them where
abundant atmospheric moisture can be supplied. A compost consisting
of two parts good substantial peat and one of loam, together
with some silver sand, suits it admirably.&mdash;<i>Gardening Illustrated.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>


<h3>CANNAS.</h3>

<p>These form a very important part of the class of which we are
treating. They give a very beautiful and tropical appearance to
the lawn and the garden by their stately growth and broad massive
foliage, relieved by rich crimson, scarlet and orange-red flowers.
Their foliage comprises various shades of green, glaucous, chocolate
and purple tints, ribbed and striped, fitting them admirably for
grouping with other plants.</p>

<p>They are also very effective for large pot plants in the pleasure-ground,
or conservatory. Under rich cultivation they will attain
the height of five feet. They need water often. Among the
newer roots <i>Creole</i>, very dark foliage, grows to the height of about
six feet. <i>Ornement du Grand Rond</i>, very tall, with large bronzy-green
foliage, large scarlet flowers. <i>Oriflamme</i> has large lanceolate-green
leaves, with violet veins, a vigorous showy plant with
salmon-orange flowers.</p>

<p>The roots of Cannas must be taken up in the autumn. If wanted
singly, divide them, if a thick clump is desirable let them be planted
out as they are. They must be kept perfectly dry through the
winter; if the cellar is very damp they will do better packed in
sand.</p>


<h3>DRACÆNA.</h3>

<p>This is a valuable genus of ornamental plants, specially fine for
the center of vases, and for pot culture. Although their culture is
on the increase, they are not so frequently grown as they deserve.
The species are very numerous, and are found in tropical countries,
especially in the islands of the tropics. Many of them assume the
proportions of trees. The largest specimen ever known was one
of Dracæna Draco, or the Dragon tree of Oratava in Teneriffe, one
of the Canary Islands. This tree was remarkable for its monstrous
dimensions and prodigious longevity. About ten years since, or in
the autumn of 1867, this magnificent specimen was destroyed by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
gale of wind. It was a special object of interest in the Canary
Islands, and received the attention and veneration of visitors, as do
the great Seguvia trees of California. Its trunk below the lowest
branches was eighty feet in height, and ten men holding hands
could scarcely encircle it; by one measurement this span around
it was seventy-nine feet. The trunk was hollow, and in the interior
was a winding stair-case, by which one might ascend as far as the
part from which the branches sprang. It is affirmed by tradition
that, when the island of Teneriffe was discovered in 1402, this tree
was as large, and the cavity in the trunk as great, as at the time of
its destruction. We are even assured that in the fifteenth century,
at the time of the conquest of the Canaries by the Normans and
Spaniards, they celebrated mass on a little altar erected in this
cavity. From the slow growth of the young Dragon trees in the
Canaries, it has been estimated that this monster tree before it was
destroyed, was the oldest plant upon the globe. A writer in describing
it says: "Long leaves pointed like swords, crowned the
extremities of the branches, and white panicles, which developed in
autumn, threw a mantle of flowers upon this dome of verdure."
The popular name of this species is Dragon's-blood Tree, because
of a resinous juice of a red color which exudes from the cracks in
its trunk. At one time this resin formed a considerable branch of
commerce, as it was used medicinally as an astringent, but it has
fallen into disuse.</p>

<p>The Dracænas belong to the Lily family, and they afford a remarkable
contrast to the palms and other arborescent endogens,
by their branching heads. The young trees of Dracæna Draco do
not, however, send out any branches, even in their native localities,
until they are thirty years old or more. The small plants of this
species, cultivated for ornament, have always a single, straight
stem; but are much more robust, and quickly assume more stately
proportions than those of the other kinds that will be mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The Dracæna is admired for its peculiar grace of form&mdash;it would
be in vain in common house culture to expect flowers. To admire
a plant for its well developed and graceful form, marks an
advancement in refined taste beyond that which would induce one
to exclaim, "Oh!" at the sight of a brilliantly colored flower.
Even in rearing a plant for flowers, the first object should be to
develop it to the fullest extent in size and shape and strength&mdash;to
make a beautiful object of the plant itself; just as the first and
main attention given to a child, for years, should be to develop and
build up its physical system.</p>

<p>The Dracæna is a good house plant, a good balcony and veranda
plant, good for the vase in the open air, and in a handsome pot is a
fine ornament for table decoration. Its culture is of the simplest
kind, adapting itself to any ordinarily good soil, it only requires to
be supplied moderately with moisture and to have a temperature
ranging upward from sixty-five degrees. It delights in a moist air,
and whenever possible, water should be kept where it will rapidly
evaporate, and thus ameliorate the atmosphere in this respect for
the plant. This condition, moreover, is conducive to the well-being
of most plants, and no good plant-grower can disregard it with impunity.
Washing the leaves and stem of the plant frequently with
a wet sponge, is favorable to its health and vigor, and one of the
best preventives of the attack of insects. With dust on the leaves
the plants look dingy, while frequent washing keeps them bright
and lustrous.</p>

<p>Dracæna indivisa has long, slender, dark green leaves, about
three-quarters of an inch or an inch in width, and from two and a
half feet to three feet in length, and the lower ones especially are
very much recurved or gracefully drooping. This species is among
the hardiest of the Dracænas, and is frequently wintered in the
open ground, with some protection in climates where the temperature
frequently descends several degrees below the freezing point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Dracæna terminalis is the most popular of the whole family in this
country, and is worthy of all the admiration bestowed upon it.
The leaves are broader and more erect than those of the preceding
species, and of a dark green suffused with red, or having streaks of
a reddish color; the young leaves nearly pink, but assuming a dark
bronzy copper color afterward. It is a very distinct and showy
plant, and adapted to a great variety of ornamental purposes. The
propagation and sale of it is rapidly increasing every year, and it is
already widely disseminated. At the Sandwich Islands it is cultivated
to a considerable extent for its roots, which are baked and
eaten. A fermented beverage is also made from the juice, and its
leaves are employed as fodder for cattle, and for clothing and other
domestic purposes.</p>

<p>Dracæna Shepherdii is of a most noble form, and is one of the
finest yet in cultivation. It has long, spreading leaves, of a metallic
green, with stripes and border of bronzy-orange, and is a very free
grower. Unlike most of the forms already known, which color
most on the free young growth of vigorous plants, this plant takes
on its distinctive coloring gradually on the older leaves.</p>

<p>Dracæna cannæfolia is an interesting species. Its peculiarity
consists in the length of petiole, which is as long as the rest of the
leaf. The blade of the leaf is elliptical in form, from fifteen to
twenty inches in length, firm, and of a glaucous green.</p>

<p>Within a few years past much attention has been given by cultivators
in Great Britain and Europe to hybridizing the Dracæna,
and producing new varieties. The most remarkable success has
attended the efforts in this direction, of <span class="smcap">Mr. Bause</span>, in the establishment
of <span class="smcap">Mr. Wills</span>, of Anerly, England. The variety is wonderful&mdash;"broad-leaved,
medium-leaved and narrow-leaved; bronzy
and green, crimson, rose, pink, violet and white variegations;
drooping, spreading, and erect habits, are blended in all sorts of
combinations."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the sorts produced is described as "a most important acquisition,
having quite the habit and character of the well-known
favorite terminalis, but with white variegation. The ground color
is a bright green, with bold, white variegation, the upper leaves
being white, with here and there a bar of green."&mdash;<i>Vick's Magazine.</i></p>


<h3>DRACÆNA GOLDIANA.</h3>

<p>Sent out in this country for the first time in 1880, is said to be
"one of the most magnificent ornamental foliage plants ever introduced,
and altogether unique in character and aspect. It is a native
of Western Tropical Africa. The plant is of erect habit, and
the stems are closely set with stalked spreading leaves, the petioles
of which are of a grayish color, terete with a narrow furrow along
the upper side, the base being dilated and sheathing the stem.
The blade of leaf is marbled and irregularly banded with dark green
and silver gray in alternate straight bands, the colors being about
equally distributed. The back of the unfolded leaves is a pale
reddish-purple or wine color, and the stem, where visible. It is,
without doubt, one of the most superb of ornamental stove plants."</p>

<p>When first sent out in London in 1878, its price was from five to
ten guineas per plant. We do not know the price in this country.
Mr. H. A. Dreer who has an illustration of it in his catalogue, furnishes
the price only on application, which is evidence that it is
costly. From the type given, it must be exceedingly handsome,
and wholly unlike any Dracæna before offered in America.</p>

<p>Dracænas, as we have noticed before, are particularly desirable
house plants, keeping in good condition for a long time, even in
rooms where gas is burned&mdash;places so unsuited to most plants.
They are liable to attacks of the Mealy Bug and the Red Spider if
neglected, but the syringing and sponging advised for them will
effectually prevent their gaining a foothold if frequently and thoroughly
performed. After a year or two the plants begin to lose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
their lower leaves, and to get leggy, a state of things quite undesirable,
as the beauty and effectiveness of the plants depend upon
their being furnished with leaves down to the base of the stem.
When the plants have become unsightly from the loss of their
leaves, they can be renewed very quickly by a simple process. Cut
a notch in the stem, on one side, just below the lowest good leaves,
and take out a piece of the wood, then do the same on the other
side of the stem, but not exactly opposite the first notch. The
object is to check the flow of sap at this point and yet allow enough
of it to pass to maintain the head. Having cut the notches, take
some moss or sphagnum and bind about the stem, covering the
incisions and fastening it on securely with twine or fine wire; the
moss is to be kept gently moist, and in the course of two weeks
will have thrown out young roots above the notches. The head
can now be severed from the stem and potted in a medium-sized
pot. After keeping it a few days in the shade, it can be gradually
brought out into the full light, and will be found to be established.</p>

<p>Dracænas may also be multiplied by removing the thick, fleshy
root that may usually be found in the base of the plant. Those
tuberous roots can be potted, and if kept in a warm place will soon
start and make new plants. When plants are re-potted a favorable
opportunity is offered for taking off these roots, for the roots of
the old plants are actively at work and, with the fresh soil they
receive, will soon recover from any slight check they may have
received.</p>

<p>The most rapid method of propagating this plant is by cuttings of
the stem; the stem may be cut into pieces an inch in length, and
those pieces split in two, and all of those bits will root and become
plants. They should be placed in a light, sandy soil, and given a
brisk bottom heat of 70° or 80° degrees. They will break and start
into growth in a few days.&mdash;<i>Vick's Magazine.</i></p>

<p>So fully does the foregoing express all that is needful regarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the Dracæna, we have thought best to give it entire. We might
greatly enlarge on the subject of Ornamental Foliage Plants, and
speak of the beautiful Palms, so fine for decorative purposes, the
pretty Ferns and elegant Aralias, of which latter "<i>Sieboldi</i> is a
capital house plant, so enduring that it will live and keep its beautiful
dark green color for weeks almost in the dark." Then there
is the Euonymus, so bright with its glossy green leaves, long a
favorite whether for the border or window garden. <i>Argentea</i> has
striped foliage, and <i>Japonicas aurea</i> has its dark green foliage
diversified with golden variegations. <i>Bicolor</i>, foliage almost white,
and <i>Tricolor</i>, a rarer form, is marked with pink and white.</p>

<p>With the numerous varieties we have named, it will be apparent
how ornamental our gardens, whether within doors or without, may
be made by plants, the beauty of which is wholly independent of
flowers, and they do wonderfully enhance the effect of the bloomers.
The Centaureas and Cinerarias with their deeply lobed leaves of
white, are too well known to need any special mention. We do
not intend however to pass so lightly over another stately and
highly ornamental genus that comes within the reach of everyone.
Ricinus, the seed of which can be purchased for a dime, are magnificent
in foliage, and when combined with the brilliant colored
fruit of the giant varieties, the effect is very oriental. Ricinus
<i>Africanus albidus</i> is of recent introduction. It is white fruited,
and the stems and leaves are silvery; height eight feet. <i>Borbaniensis
arboreus</i> has very large and showy foliage; height fifteen
feet. <i>Communis</i> is the Castor Oil Plant. <i>Sanguineus</i> (Obermanii)
bears splendid red fruit in clusters, and is very ornamental. A
species from Phillippines has gigantic foliage; height ten feet.
These can be purchased in separate or mixed packets, and we
advise everyone who has a bit of ground to try them. We will
close with</p>

<h3>A BIG BEAN STORY.</h3>

<p>I have just harvested my Ricinus or Castor Bean, which I raised
from the seed you sent me last spring. It was of mammoth growth,
attaining a height of fourteen and a half feet, and sixteen feet
across the branches of which there were seventeen after cutting
off five during the summer. Each of the branches contained a
cluster of burs, the center one having one hundred and thirty-four
burs, the other branches not so many. Many of the leaves measured
from thirty to thirty-two inches across from tip to tip or point of
leaves. When sawed off at the ground, the body measured five
inches and a half of wood in diameter, inside of the bark, which
was one-fourth of an inch thick. This is a big bean story but nevertheless
a true one.&mdash;<span class="smaller">T. G. T.</span> in <i>Vick's Magazine</i>.</p>

We know of none equal to</p>


<h3>THE CHINESE PRIMROSE,</h3>

<p>for common house culture, commencing to flower usually in November,
and continuing through the spring months. The seed for
this ought to be sown in April&mdash;if later the plants will not come
into bloom so early. The soil for Primroses in all stages should
be fine, light and rich, with a good mixture of sand.</p>

<p>For seed sowing it can be put in pans, boxes or six inch pots.
First, put in drainage&mdash;I use for this coarse sand&mdash;then the coarse
siftings of the soil. On this to the depth of one and a half or two
inches, put the fine mixed soil, press down smoothly and spray
lightly with tepid water. Sow the seed on the surface, and sift on
enough of the fine earth to partially but not fully cover them.
Cover with a glass, or with a bit of soft nice flannel, and place in
the shade where a mild moist temperature can be attained. Where
flannel is used, it can be kept damp and thus impart moisture to
the seeds without their being saturated, washed bare, or displaced
by spraying. When the seed has germinated, then glass can be
substituted. The tender seedlings must be gradually brought to
the sunlight; too long exposure at first would kill them, and if kept
in the shade too much they will become drawn and dwarfed. This
is the critical period, and many fail at this point. Great care is
essential till the plants put forth the third leaf, which is rough and
the true primula leaf. Then the plants must be carefully transplanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
into other pots prepared as before. In about a month the
glass can be removed and the plants potted separately, setting them
low, as it is a peculiarity of the Primula to stretch itself up out of
the soil, and become shaky. It is necessary sometimes to give
them support. In watering, care must be had to prevent the water
lodging in the axils of the leaves, which cause them to decay. They
will not bear showering like smooth surfaced plants, and only occasionally
should they be sprayed through a fine hose. They must
be kept during the summer months in a shady place, and have a
cool bottom to stand on; a cold frame is the best. They must be
housed by the end of September, and the best situation for them is
a light, airy shelf near the glass, yet not exposed to intense sunshine.
They do not like frequent changes of position and temperature,
nor to be grown with other plants. Give them a cool place
where they will have the morning or afternoon sun for a time.
During the blossoming season stimulate the soil once a week with
liquid manure, or water with a few drops of ammonia added. Pick
off all flowers as fast as they fade. Plants are stronger and better
the second year, and unless they get too shaky, are good for three
years. They must, after blossoming, be taken out of the pot, the
ball of earth reduced from the roots, and then re-potted in fresh
soil. It is not needful to keep them dormant and shaded through
the summer, but in a cool and partially secluded position, they will
after a brief rest begin to grow, putting forth frequently little crowns
all around about the old one, and be full of blossoms during the
autumn and winter months. The double varieties are not so easily
grown, and cannot be recommended for general culture to be raised
from seed. Fine plants can be procured from the florists, but the
large single sorts, we think give the most satisfaction. Ellis Brothers,
Keene, N. H., have sent us for trial, packets of very fine strains;
some are rare, and, judging from the description, must be very beautiful.
It is not often that we find more than four varieties named in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the catalogues. They send out a dozen sorts, some of which we
will name: <i>Primula Fimbriata Kermesina Splendens;</i> Large
flowers, brilliant velvet like crimson, yellow eye. <i>Primula Frimbriata
Punctata Elegantissima;</i> a new variety; flower velvety crimson,
edge spotted with white; very distinct. <i>Primula Fimbriata
Striata;</i> beautifully striped. <i>Primula Fringed</i>, <i>Fern Leaf;</i> pure
white, with large citron eye; very fine. <i>Primula Globosa</i>, new;
a large flowering, fringed sort; petals large and many of them
crimped, each overlapping the other, so that they appear almost
semi-double; colors white, light pink, crimson and lilac pink. All
of these can be bought in mixed or separate packets. We cannot
find room for all of these, but hope from the rarest to obtain some
fine plants to brighten our room the coming winter. Great advances
have been made since the Primrose was introduced into
this country little more than half a century ago.</p>

<p>Of the novelties we find in
the London <i>Garden</i> special mention
made of Primula Sinensis
Fimbriata Alba Magnifica. The
writer says: "The Primulas
from Mr. B. S. Williams' Victoria
Nurseries, Holloway, were
remarkably fine. The newest
sort shown, Alba Magnifica,
promises to be an excellent kind;
the flowers are large, produced
in dense and many flowered
trusses, borne well above the foliage, which is also remarkable being
elegantly crisped at the margins. The color is white, the purity of
which, however, is more strongly marked when the plants are more
mature than those shown; the habit of growth is very robust."</p>

<p>Of this novelty Mr. H. Cannell says: "The new white Primula<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
is of exquisite form and substance; the plants are exceedingly
compact, with deeply indented leaves of a light green color; the
flowers measure two and one-quarter inches in diameter, pure
white, with large, bright yellow eye, each petal being deeply and
beautifully fringed, and are borne in large trusses well above the
foliage."</p>

<p>We give an illustration of this Primula, kindly furnished by Ellis
Bros., who are of the first to offer it in this country.</p>


<h3><a id="CARNATIONS_AND_PICOTEES"></a>CARNATIONS AND PICOTEES.</h3>

<p>"What is the difference between them? I am told differently by
nearly every florist I ask. An old Englishman told me the other
day that he used to grow great quantities of them in England, and
that the difference between the two is, that the Picotee has fringed
edged leaves, while in the Carnation proper the edge of the leaf is
smooth like a rose."</p>

<p>The question is asked of Mr. Vick, and he thus replies: "The
Carnation and Picotee differ only in the arrangement of the color,
or markings. The distinction is made by florists, and is of course
arbitrary. Seeds saved from one plant, may produce both Carnations
and Picotee, or even from the same seed-pod. In an old work
in our possession, the distinction is as stated, but for long years
any flower with an irregular edge has been considered unworthy
of propagation. The Carnation should have broad stripes of color
running through from the center to the edge of the petals. The
Picotee has only a band of color on the edge of each petal."&mdash;<i>Vick's
Magazine.</i></p>

<p>Although Mr. Vick here states that the Carnation should have
broad stripes of color, neither he, nor any other florist makes this
distinction, but call pure white, and pure red Carnations, just as
freely as those that are striped.</p>

<p>There are two classes of Carnations, and thousands of varieties.
The class of Perpetual Bloomers are called Monthly and Tree Carnations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
The Garden Carnations are hardy, and can be left in the
garden during winter by giving them a covering of leaves, straw, or
evergreen boughs. They are easily raised from seed. Sown in
June or July, will make good robust plants before frost, which will
bloom the following summer. Some of them will be single, perhaps,
and these can be removed. Those of superior merit may be
multiplied by <i>layering</i>. This method is to select good healthy
shoots that have not bloomed, and make a cut midway between two
joints. First cut half way through the shoot, then make a slit
lengthwise to a joint. Remove the earth a few inches in depth,
and press the branch down so that this slit will open, and then
cover with the soil. Roots will form where the cut was made, and
thus a new plant will be formed, which can be removed in the autumn
or spring. Midsummer is the best time to do this, and by
adopting this method good, healthy plants are secured. The plants
should be well watered a day or two before layering is commenced,
and immediately afterward&mdash;then only occasionally. They are frequently
propagated by cuttings, which can be rooted in wet sand,
or in light sandy soil.</p>


<h3>PERPETUAL BLOOMERS,</h3>

<p>Or Monthly Carnations, can be easily obtained of the florists
for summer or winter blooming; the former purchased in the
spring, and the latter in the autumn. If one raises their own
stock, it is not best to allow those to bloom much during the summer
that are wanted for winter flowering. It is well to sink the pots
in a good sunny place in the garden, and when they run up and
show signs of bedding, cut back the stalk so that it may become
more compact and branchy, then the buds in the late autumn or
winter, will be much more numerous. The best for winter blooming
are <i>La Purite</i> (carmine), <i>President de Graw</i> (white), <i>Peerless</i>
(white, striped with pink) and <i>Peter Henderson</i>, of the well-known
varieties. Of those of recent introduction, <i>Lady Emma</i> is said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
be excellent. One florist says that "it is destined to be one of the
leading winter-blooming Carnations. From my bed of one thousand
plants in the green-house throughout December and January
last, I plucked more blooms than from any other variety occupying
the same space." It has proved excellent also for a bedding pink.
Its color is a rare shade of crimson scarlet; the flower is of medium
size, full and double, and never bursting down the side. <i>Lord Clyde</i>
has for three years proved to be an excellent winter bloomer. It is
of a very robust growth, like its parent the <i>Edwardsii</i>, but of a more
dwarf, low-flowering habit. The ground-work is white, thickly
striped with carmine, and a frequent blotch of maroon; very floriferous,
each stem bearing from six to eight flowerets. <i>Lydia</i> is
another of the recent novelties, and is very handsome. Flowers
very large and intensely double, of a rich rosy, orange color blotched
and flecked with carmine. <i>Crimson King</i> is one of the largest
Carnations, very full, bushy habit, and robust, color crimson-scarlet.
A pure bright scarlet is rare; when therefore, <i>Firebrand</i>, a novelty
of 1880, was announced as a bright scarlet, it produced quite a sensation.
It is very highly commended by those who have seen it.
<i>Grace Wilder</i>, <i>Princess Louise</i> and <i>Fred Johnson</i>, are new hybrid
seedlings now offered for the first time to the public.</p>

<p>There was quite a discussion in the <i>Gardener's Monthly</i> of last
year as to the best pure White Carnation. In the August number,
Mr. E. Fryer of Delaware writes: "The varieties called <i>Peter Henderson</i>,
sent out by Nanz and Neuner I have found to be the best
white I have yet grown for winter bloom. It is a stronger and
better bloomer than de Graw, its only drawback being that it runs
up high like <i>La Purite</i>. <i>Snowdon</i> is a true dwarf, pure white, and
if it proves a good winter bloomer, will probably supersede all other
whites, the flower being of fair size and very fragrant. Bock's
Seedling, <i>Charles Sumner</i>, I have grown the past winter. The
flower is of an enormous size, but it invariably bursts before opening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and is a dull unattractive color. <i>Waverly</i> I have also grown
last winter&mdash;a splendid variety, rich crimson scarlet; the color was
no way exaggerated as represented in the <i>Monthly</i> a year ago;
produces a fair average of flowers to the plant, flowers selling readily
at ten cents each. I think this the most useful color to the commercial
florist.</p>

<p>"I still cling to the old carmine <i>La Purite</i>, which for quantity of
bloom, size of flower and general good qualities, I think has not
been beat by any of the newer varieties for winter bloom." Mr.
Peter Henderson, one of the leading florists, places <i>Snowdon</i>
above all other white Carnations, its dwarf habit making it specially
desirable.</p>

<p>Florist's Pinks are more dwarf than the Carnations, flowers very
double, clove scented, and are of various shades of maroon, carmine,
crimson and rose interlaced with white.</p>


<h3>THE ORIGIN OF THE FLORIST'S PINK.</h3>

<p>The <i>Gardener's Chronicle</i> gives the following interesting account
of the origin of this class: "It may be interesting to record the
fact, published in an old number of the <i>Floricultural Cabinet</i>, that
the first Pink worthy of notice was raised in the year 1772, by
Mr. <span class="smcap">James Major</span> who was then gardener to the duchess of Lancaster;
previous to that there were but four sorts, and those of very
little note, being cultivated as only common border flowers. Mr.
<span class="smcap">Major</span> having saved some seed in 1771, he reared several plants,
which, blooming the next season, one of the number proved to be a
double flower with laced petals, at which he was agreeably surprised,
although he considered it as being only in embryo, and the
prelude to still further advance to be developed at some future
period, which is now verified by the rapid strides this beautiful
flower made in size and quality during the years which followed.
Mr. <span class="smcap">Major</span> informed the writer of the foregoing remarks that he
made his discovery known to a nurseryman or florist and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
offered the sum of ten guineas for the stock of his new Pink; but,
acting on the advice of his friends, he declined to sell, and set to
work instead and increased the stock with a view of offering it in
sale to the public. It was sent out to the public at half a guinea a
pair (for it has long been a custom of offering Pinks in pairs, a
custom which is continued to this day), under the name of <span class="smcap">Major's</span>
Duchess of Lancaster, the orders for which amounted to £80. It
is recorded that one individual ordered as many as twenty pairs,
which was considered in those days an unusually large number. It
would be interesting to have a bloom of Duchess of Lancaster to
compare with the fine double varieties of the present day. We
appear to have come to something like a pause in the matter of
Pink production as the flowers are now very large and full, and the
lacing is as perfect as can well be conceived."</p>


<h3>DIANTHUS.</h3>

<p>The word is derived from the Greek words <i>Dios</i>, divine, and
<i>Anthos</i>, a flower; God's flower, or the flower of Jove. There are
several species, and many varieties of Dianthus; <i>Dianthus Caryophyllus</i>
is what is commonly known as the Clove Pink, and from it
have been produced the double varieties called Carnations and Picotees.
The plant in its wild state is found growing on the south
side of the Swiss Alps, at a low altitude, where the winters are not
severe. The common perennial garden Pink is <i>Dianthus Plumarias</i>.
The old and well-known Chinese Pink, <i>Dianthus Chinensis</i>, is a
biennial, flowering the first season from seed sown in spring, lives
during the winter, blooms the second year, and then dies. New
and superb varieties have been introduced of late years from Japan,
and <i>Dianthus Laciniatus</i>, and <i>Dianthus Heddewigii</i>, both single
and double, make a splendid display, and are among the most desirable
of our garden flowers. <i>Dianthus Diadematus</i> is of dwarf
habit, very profuse in blooming, and the flowers are of various hues,
from white to dark maroon, and also beautifully marbled and spotted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Of the recent novelties <i>Eastern Queen</i> and <i>Crimson Belle</i> are
superb; we speak from personal knowledge. "Eastern Queen" is
beautifully marbled; the broad bands of rich mauve upon the paler
surface of the petals are very striking. "Crimson Belle," as its
name implies, is of a rich crimson hue, with dark markings; very
large and finely fringed.</p>

<p>For early blooming it is well to sow seed as early as April. June
sowing will secure good hardy plants for the following season.
When there is a profusion of bloom, it is well to remove a portion
of the flowers, so that the plants may not become exhausted, and
the seed pods beyond what are desired for ripening, ought also to
be cut off.</p>

and admiring other people's flowers. Visited the
Public Garden of Boston and saw that there had been a
marked improvement within ten years. The massed beds
of several sorts, with their contrasting borders, were very attractive,
specially the maroon Coleuses with border of Centaurea.
There were few varieties of Geraniums, and these were mostly
massed in beds, some all scarlet, others wholly pink.</p>

<p>At Forest Hills Cemetery there was the finest display of flowers
and tropical plants I ever saw, and they are very artistically and
tastefully displayed. I saw several beds with artistic designs on a
ground work of Sempervivum, evidencing great skill in the arrangement
and culture. The entrance gateway to Forest Hills Cemetery
is very beautiful in design, and here we saw that graceful climber
Ampeclopsis Veitchii, in the perfection of its beauty, covering the
front almost entirely. I had noted it in various stages of growth,
clinging to the dwellings in all parts of the city, requiring no aid
but its own little rootlets. It is a native of Japan and was introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
in this country twelve years ago. It was slow at first in
being duly appreciated, but now is widely known and extensively
propagated. Probably the finest plant is owned by Mr. George L.
Conover of Geneva, N. Y. It covers the entire front of his two-story
square house, and has become so famous that horticulturists
from all parts of the country have been attracted by it, and a great
many people have visited Geneva for the special purpose of seeing
this fine plant. It has proved to be perfectly hardy, only the first
year the young and tender plant needs some protection during the
winter. Florists are growing them in great quantities to meet the
increasing demand. It can be obtained for twenty cents. I received
a small plant last year and kept it in my window box during
the winter. It died down, however, and I quite forgot about it, till
it sprang forth anew in April. Since putting it in the ground it
has grown rapidly, and I shall value it now more than ever.</p>


<h3>HONEYSUCKLE.</h3>

<p><i>The Golden-Leaved Honeysuckle</i> is a special favorite of mine. Its
leaves are so netted and veined with yellow as to give this hue the
predominance. The foliage is small; the flowers are yellow and
fragrant. The family of <i>Lonicerus</i>, or Honeysuckle, embraces a
large variety. The botanical name was given in honor of <i>Lonicer</i>,
a German botanist, who died about three hundred years ago.</p>

<p><i>Lonicerus Holliana</i> was introduced into this country from Japan
by Dr. Hall. The flowers are pure white when they first open, but
assume a creamy tinge in a few days. This variety blooms almost
continuously from June till frost. It attains sometimes to the height
of twenty, and even thirty feet. The flowers are very fragrant.</p>

<p><i>Belgian</i>, or Monthly Fragrant, bears its blossoms in clusters.
They are pure white in the interior at first, but afterward change
to creamy yellow, deepening into orange.</p>

<p><i>Sempervirens</i> (Scarlet Trumpet) is a native of this country, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
perfectly hardy. This is the most common, though not fragrant.
It is a strong grower, and blooms from June to November. Its
scarlet flowers tinged with orange afford a pleasing contrast with
its dark, glossy foliage.</p>


<h3>CANARY BIRD FLOWER.</h3>

<p>For an out-door annual climber, what can be prettier than the
dainty, graceful Canary Flower? Mine have scorned the limitations
of the twine I had fastened to the lower limbs of a small pear tree
and ascending far above them, have run out a full yard on a large
branch. The light green, finely lacinated foliage is very handsome
of itself, but when the Canary bird flower is added, how lovely it
is! It is so easily grown from seed that I wonder so few have it.
A paper costing only ten cents would give you a score of plants,
and they are much prettier for the bay window than Madeira vines.</p>

<p>A writer from England says: "While in the north of England,
last fall, we paid a visit to <a id="TN3">Alnwick</a> Castle, the seat of the Duke of
Northumberland, and the ancient home of the Percy family....
The first thing that struck me on entering the town was a bay window
most charmingly draped with light green climbers, and literally
covered with bright lemon yellow flowers. Now this appeared so
strange to me (for the chilly night air had already affected the
geraniums and other tender out-door plants), that I had to cross
the street, take the Yankee liberty to open the gate, go inside and
examine this thrifty beauty. I confess I was not only surprised but
greatly interested to find it was <i>only</i> the Canary flower, <i>Tropaeolum
peregrinum</i>, a member of the Nasturtium family, and I concluded at
once that there should be one cottage in America next summer
worth coming miles to see on account of its climbing plants of light
green foliage and rich yellow masses of Canary bird flower."&mdash;<span class="smaller">WALTON</span>,
in <i>Vick's Magazine</i>.</p>

<p>Do not forget to include this pretty vine in your seed order next
year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>


<h3>COB&OElig;A SCANDENS.</h3>

<p>This is one of the best of our climbing annuals, on account of its
rapid and luxuriant growth, attractive foliage and large bell-shaped
flowers. Under favorable circumstances they will grow to the
height of twenty and even thirty feet in a summer. They commence
to bloom when quite young, and continue in bloom until
destroyed by frost. Some people remove them from the border to
the house for winter blooming, but the change from out-door to indoor
life, often retards their growth and mars their beauty. They
are too cumbersome for window plants after having grown during
the season, and it is better to sow seed in August, and get in this
way plants for the house. They are hard to germinate, and need
to be started in pots or in a hot bed. Place them in moist earth
<i>edge down</i>, and do not water until the young plants appear above
the surface, unless the earth becomes very dry.</p>

<p>For out-door blooming sow in March or April. As soon as the
plants are strong enough, transplant to three-inch pots; keep them
shaded from the sun for a few days, gradually expose to the open
air, and plant out when all danger from frost is over. The soil
should be well stirred to the depth of nearly two feet, and well
rotted manure worked in. In dry weather they need liberal watering
as often as once a week, and liquid manure water occasionally
is of great benefit to them.</p>

<p>The Cob&oelig;a can be propagated by layers at almost any season
of the year. It is done in this way: Cut a notch near a joint,
place in a pot and fill with soil, and keep the soil moist. It takes
from two weeks to a month for them to root.</p>

<p>A writer says of this plant: "The Cob&oelig;a is an old favorite
and it is worthy of remark that but few of the novelties introduced
of late years can equal some of the old favorites that we have been
accustomed to grow. The Cob&oelig;a is a native of Mexico, from
which country it was introduced in 1792. It was named in honor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
of Bernandez Cobo, a Spanish priest and botanist. The growth of
the vine is very luxuriant, and it is equally easy of cultivation, the
only essentials to success being warmth, a rich, light soil, and sufficient
water. If allowed to become very dry, it will soon wither
away. It requires sun and a warm room to grow it to perfection;
yet it is not a tender plant, that is, it will live anywhere, provided
the frost does not touch it, and is one of the few plants which will
flourish luxuriantly in parlors lighted with gas and kept almost at
fever heat. If grown in a hanging basket or pot, it must be large
and the roots allowed plenty of room to spread out in. In the summer
the pots can be removed from the interior room to a balcony
or piazza, or plunged until they are again wanted. Then clip off
the growth of branches and leaves, place the pot back again in a
sunny window, where it will soon start afresh, with new arms and
leaves to cover the window. It is one of the best vines for parlor
decoration, as it will drape and festoon the window, and stretch
forth its tendrils, running up even to the ceiling. The tendrils are
so clinging in their nature that they will attach themselves to anything
which comes within their reach&mdash;curtain cords, branches of
other plants, brackets, etc.,&mdash;throwing out new branches everywhere.</p>

<p>"I advise all who adopt the plan of plunging the plant in the
pot in the open air during the summer, either to shift into a pot
two sizes larger, or else to take it out of the pot and reduce the
ball of earth nearly one-half, and repot it in fresh compost before
removing it to the house. This should be done not later than September
10th. The plants will amply repay this little attention by
an increased luxuriance of both foliage and flowers during the winter
months, while plants not so treated will become sickly and unhealthy
before spring, and beside, when pot-bound, they soon become
the prey of numerous insects."</p>

<p>There are several varieties of the Cob&oelig;a, though <i>scandens</i> is the
most generally known. The large bell-shaped flowers are greenish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
at first, but rapidly change to a dull purple. Cob&oelig;a Scandens <i>Alba</i>
has greenish white flowers. Cob&oelig;a <i>variegata</i> is one of the most magnificent
ornamental climbers, the leaves being broadly margined
with yellowish white, the variegated foliage forming a beautiful contrast
with its large purple flowers. It is of strong habit, a rapid
grower, attaining frequently the height of fifty feet in a short time.
It is, however, difficult of propagation, rooting with difficulty. The
seeds vegetate as readily as the common sort, but the plants are
apt to die off soon after attaining their seed leaves. Layering in
the manner already specified, is the best method of increase.</p>

<p>Cob&oelig;a scandens <i>argentea</i> is another variegated leaved variety,
differing from <i>variegata</i> in that its leaves are of a purer white. It is
described by some as being identical with Cob&oelig;a scandens, Schuerens
Seedling, but by Messrs. Leeds &amp; Co., of Richmond, Indiana,
as being "a great improvement on the old variegated variety.
Leaves large, green, bordered with creamy white; calyx of the
flowers variegated like the leaves."</p>


<h3>CLEMATIS.</h3>

<p>Clematis (<i>Virgin's Bower</i>), derives its name from <i>klema</i>, a vine-branch.
The popular name, Virgin's Bower, was given to <i>Clematis
Viticella</i> upon its introduction into England during the reign of
Elizabeth, 1569, and was intended as a compliment to that sovereign,
who liked to be called the Virgin Queen.</p>

<p>There are, it is said, two hundred and thirty described species,
the majority of them free-growing, hardy climbers. They are
among the most gorgeous perpetual-blooming of the class under
consideration. Great improvements have been made during the
past twenty-five years by hybridization, but the finest varieties
have originated within ten years. Of the new English hybrids
<i>Jackmanii</i> stands in the front rank. The flowers are from five to
six inches in diameter, and consist of from four to six sepals which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
have a ribbed bar down the center; the color is of an intense violet-purple,
remarkable for its velvety richness, and a shading of reddish-purple
toward the base, and they are furnished with a broad central
tuft of pale green stamens. It originated with Jackman &amp; Son,
England, and was first exhibited at Kensington, 1872. It is a
cross between <i>Clematis Viticella</i> and <i>Clematis Lanuginasa</i>. From
this cross many excellent seedlings have been raised, closely resembling
the parent stock in color and general character.</p>

<p>Of Jackman's Clematises the English <i>Gardener</i> has the following:
"They are magnificent; and more than this, they do give us
some of the grandest things in the way of creepers the horticultural
world has ever seen, making glorious ornaments either for walls,
verandas, or rustic poles or pillars, varying in color from deep rich
violet hue to dark velvety maroon, and in the newer seedlings,
forms beautiful shades of pale bright blue."</p>

<p>Mr. Vick says of the Clematis: "Having a rather unsightly pile
of stones in the back part of our grounds, we had them thrown together
more in the form of a stone-heap, perhaps, than of anything
worthy of the name of rockery, and planted <i>Jackmanii</i> and other
fine sorts in the crevices, and for three summers this stone-heap
has been covered most gorgeously. Thousands of flowers, in fact
a mound of flowers, every day for months, has been the delight of
visitors, causing one to exclaim, 'Nothing since Paradise has been
more beautiful.'"</p>

<p>These fine hybrids will endure our Northern winters if somewhat
protected. A gentleman in Rochester, N. Y., had a Jackmanii
which bore full exposure without protection and came out in the
spring uninjured to the height of nine feet. The extremities of the
shoots for about two feet were winter-killed.</p>

<p><i>Clematis Sieboldii</i> is a native of Japan, whence it was introduced
by Mr. Low in 1837. It is of a slender free-growing habit. "The
flowers which are produced from July to September are composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
of six ovate sepals of a creamy white color, which form a fine background
for the large rosette of purple stamens which occupy the
center and render the flowers particularly attractive."</p>

<p><i>Clematis graveolins</i> is a native of the mountains of Thibet. It
is of comparative recent introduction. The flowers are produced on
long stalks at the axils of the leaves, and are of a light yellow&mdash;an
unusual color in this genus. It grows to the height of from ten to
fifteen feet, and blooms freely during the entire season.</p>

<p>A lady writes to Vick's Magazine that she has a Clematis graveolins
which is a wonderful sight. It grew from a feeble plant planted
out in spring, two inches in height, into a column twelve feet high
and three feet broad by August, and was a mass of yellow blossoms,
and then, of the most exquisite, long-haired, silvery seed pods until
hard frost. It lived through the winter, to its extreme tips, and
then grew so rapidly, shading such an important part of her garden,
that she had to remove it in the autumn, cutting it back severely.
The seedlings from it grow, she adds, to eight or ten feet in a
season.</p>

<p><i>Clematis crispa</i> is of Southern origin; the flowers are one and a
half inches long, produced singly on long stalks, and delightfully fragrant,
a rapid grower, and perfectly hardy. <i>Clematis coccinea</i> is of
recent introduction from Texas, the flowers are bell-shaped, of a most
brilliant scarlet, and are produced in great abundance. This rare
variety is offered only by Woolson &amp; Co., Passaic Falls, N. J., who
make a specialty of hardy herbaceous plants. <i>Vesta</i>, a Jackman, is
large and of fine form; dead white, with a creamy tinge over the
center bar, delicate primrose fragrance, an early bloomer. <i>Mrs.
James Bateman</i>, pale lavender, and <i>Thomas Moore</i>, violet, superb,
are Jackman seedlings, which flower in the summer and autumn,
successionally, in masses, on summer shoots. These are all high
priced. Many fine sorts can be purchased at prices ranging from
thirty cents to one dollar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>The Clematis requires only ordinary garden soil. Where there
are severe winters it is best to give the young plants at least some
protection. They can be propagated by layering, which is rather
a slow method, or rapidly by seed.</p>


<h3>WISTARIA.</h3>

<p>Very beautiful among the hard-wooded Climbers, is the Chinese
Wistaria when in bloom. Its long, pendulous racemes of blue
flowers are exceedingly graceful. They are frequently twelve inches
in length and highly fragrant. The flowers appear about the last
of May and first of June. It is not a continuous bloomer like the
Clematis, but often gives a few flowers in August. It is rather
slow at first, but after getting a good start the second or third year
grows very rapidly. It is hardy after it gets strong, but young
plants need some protection.</p>

<p>The Chinese White Wistaria was introduced by Mr. Fortune,
and is regarded as a great acquisition. The <i>Double Purple</i> is illustrated
in Ellwanger &amp; Barry's Catalogue, by a full page engraving,
which gives one an idea of its beauty better than the description
which is as follows: "A rare and charming variety, with perfectly
double flowers, deeper in color than the single, and with racemes
of remarkable length. The plant is perfectly hardy, resembling
Wistaria <i>Sinensis</i>, so well known as one of our best climbing plants.
The stock which we offer was purchased of Mr. Parkman, who
received this variety from Japan in 1863, and was the first to bloom
and exhibit it in this country."</p>

<p><i>White American Wistaria</i> is a seedling originating with Messrs.
Ellwanger &amp; Barry, of Rochester, N. Y. Flowers clear white;
bushes short. Free bloomer.</p>


<h3>CHINESE WISTARIA AS A STANDARD.</h3>

<p>A novelty has been offered to the horticultural public of London
this spring (1880), in the shape of standard trees of Wistaria Sinensis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
raised in tubs, having heads five or six feet in diameter and
covered with clusters of bloom. The plants were raised in Rouen,
France, and sent to London for sale. It requires several years to
attain plants of good size in this style, and as a matter of profit, a
strict account would no doubt show a balance on the wrong side.
In this country where the Wistaria is "at home," it may be raised
in tree-shape in the open ground without expense, save the necessary
care in pinching in and shaping. "So completely did the plants
offered in London strike the popular taste, that there was quite a
competition to become purchasers of them, and large sums were
offered by those anxious to possess them. The general public,
unaccustomed to this fine Chinese climber, looked on with wonder
at "Lilacs" of such unwanted size and beauty of color."&mdash;<i>Vick's
Magazine.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Vick evidently does not deem this method an improvement
on the natural graceful climber, for it reminds him of an anecdote
which he thus relates in reply to an inquirer respecting the Wistaria
as a standard.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time some kind of a steam cannon was invented,
and a day of trial was arranged at Portsmouth, England, to which
the Lords of the Admiralty and the Duke of Wellington were invited.
After the exhibition, which we believe was somewhat successful,
opinions of its merits were freely expressed, but the Iron
Duke said nothing. When urged to give his opinion, he replied
that he was thinking&mdash;'thinking if the steam gun had been first invented,
what a grand improvement gunpowder would have been.'
If the Chinese Wistaria had been a tree, and some one could have
induced it to climb and cover our porches and arbors and old trees
and buildings, what a grand improvement it would have been."</p>

<span class="hidden">W</span>HAT changes have been manifested&mdash;how unceasingly
and with what deftness Nature has silently wrought in
tapestry and embroidery, sculpture and painting, till
beauty is all around us, in the green carpet of earth,
brightened with flowers and leafage of every hue! No wonder the
birds sing praises to Him who gave them life with its fullness of
blessings. Sad to think that man, high over all, and under the
greatest obligation, too often is silent in thanksgiving for the gifts
of a Father's love.</p>

<p>No month to me has such charms as June, when nature's robes
are so fresh and clean, and the balmy air is redolent with fragrance.
How delightful to be abroad with the early worm and early bird,
working in the garden, while the songsters give free concerts, and
the hum of the honey bird, and buzz of the bee, set forth a good
example of cheerful industry!</p>

<p>The house plants have become established in the open border,
and are so glad to get away from artificial heat and confined atmosphere
into the broad sunlight of heaven, and breathe in full
draughts of pure air and sweet dew, that they put on their best attire,
and most attractive ornaments. Before the roses bloom, the
bed of geraniums looks bright with flowers, each ambitious to excel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
his or her neighbor, either in beauty of color, or form, or duration
of bloom, thus leaving me in perplexity as to choice. When <i>Pliny</i>
bloomed everybody admired who saw his beauty; then <i>Romeo</i> with
quite another style looked charming, but when <i>Naomi</i> unfolded her
large trusses of double pips, of a rare, peculiar shade, nobody ever
saw a geranium quite so lovely, and then its duration of bloom&mdash;full
six weeks! <i>Jennie Dolfus</i>, however, became a dangerous rival&mdash;a
deeper, richer shade, and not a pip would she allow to fade so long
as <i>Naomi</i> looked so pert. Some said, "I like <i>Naomi</i> the best;"
others said, "I think <i>Jennie</i> is the prettiest." But <i>Beauty</i>, close by,
hearing the praises lavished on her sisters, and perchance trusting
in her good name, came forth one day in dress of white with deep
pink ornamentation. Never had such unique beauty as this ever
been seen in Geranium before, and, "Isn't it lovely!" "Just splendid!"
"What a beauty!" were uttered with exclamation points,
till she blushed with becoming modesty&mdash;the flush spread and deepened
until her face was completely suffused with the delicate tint,
making her yet more attractive. <i>Wellington</i> donned his crimson
suit, and <i>De Gasx</i> an orange yellow; <i>Pauline Lucca</i>, prima donna
though she be, appeared in dress of pure white, and <i>Richard Dean</i>
in scarlet with a white star that was very becoming. <i>New Life</i> thought to draw special attention by odd freaks, and came out in a
parti-colored dress of the most singular combinations; part of it
was scarlet dotted with white&mdash;part of it half scarlet, half salmon,
part of it widely striped, and part white with just a flush of pink!
I must call him the clown of the family!</p>

<p>I have only named a few of the rare Geraniums that adorn one
of the beds of my garden. For beauty, free flowering, and duration
of bloom they cannot be surpassed.</p>

<p>Interspersed with them are ornamental leaved Geraniums, <i>Crystal
Palace Gem</i>, an improvement on <i>Cloth of Gold;</i> <i>Marshal McMahon</i>,
the best of all the bronzes; <i>Cherub</i>, deep green, white and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
orange, flowers carmine; <i>Glen Eyre Beauty</i>, <i>Dr. Livingstone</i>, a new,
sweet-scented, fine cut-leaved Geranium; <i>Happy Thought</i>, one of
the most attractive, with its dark green leaves and creamy white
center. Here and there are commingled Anchryanthus of divers
hues, and Coleosus, giving a fine effect to the whole. This is now
the most attractive bed of all, but when the Lilies are in bloom, and
the dear little Tea Roses, the bed parallel with it will be the sweetest,
if not so brilliant.</p>

<p>This year I have a tropical bed of oblong form. A Castor Bean
rises majestically in the center, two beautiful Cannas each side,
while a Dracæna, a splendid Croton, two fancy Caladiums, and a
few other choice plants fill the space, the whole bordered with Coxcombs.
In a few weeks this bed will look gorgeous, and those filled
with annuals will have changed from their present inattractiveness
to delightful bloom. August is really the month of fullness of
blossom, and of restful enjoyment of beauty and fragrance. The
weary days of preparation, of bedding out and of weeding, are over,
and one may now give themselves up to the enjoyment of the fruit
of their labor, till the chill nights of autumn bring a renewal of the
toil.</p>

<p>"Does the brief period of restful enjoyment repay for the many
weary days antecedent and subsequent?"</p>

<p>Yes, richly, fully, for there is pleasure with the toil, and to me
health-giving influences that energize the physical system for indoor
work, and stimulate the brain for literary pursuits. To me my
garden is a God-send, fraught with blessings.</p>

<p>"Gardening is a pleasant pastime." I am prepared to adopt that
sentiment to-day, if I did demur somewhat last month. It is a delightful
pastime, in the early morning, to spend an hour among the
flowers, trowel in hand, rooting out the weeds, loosening the soil
around your plants, and tying up here and there the tall and fragile,
while the birds are singing in the trees around you their morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
song of gladness. How the dew-laden grass and shrubs impart
sweetness to the air, and your lungs inhaling its purity, are
expanded and invigorated, your whole system feels the better for
the tonic, and prepares for breakfast, and the work that shall follow.</p>

<p>It is a pleasant pastime, when wearied with toil you go forth for
a time among your flowers and search for the buds, or examine the
newly-opened flower. How it rests you!</p>

<p>It is a pleasant pastime, when the labors of the day are over, and
the sun is throwing long shadows from the west, you take watering-pot
in hand, and shower the refreshing spray upon your plants,
cleansing them from the dust, and cooling them after the heat.
How they thrive, and bud and bloom!</p>

<h3>LAST WORDS OF THE POET HEINE.</h3>

<p><img src="images/i_121b.jpg" class="dropcap" alt="O" title="O" height="95" width="58" />
<span class="hidden">O</span>F the many touching tributes paid to flowers, there is a
beautiful one associated with the closing hours of Henry
Heine, the poet. He was dying in Paris. The doctor was
paying his usual visit, when Heine pressed his hand and
said: "Doctor, you are my friend, I ask a last favor. Tell me the
truth&mdash;the end is approaching, is it not?"</p>

<p>The doctor was silent.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Heine calmly.</p>

<p>"Have you any request to make?" asked the doctor, moved to
tears.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the poet; "my wife sleeps&mdash;do not disturb her.
Take from the table the fragrant flowers she brought me this morning.
I love flowers so dearly. Thanks&mdash;place them upon my
breast." He paused, as he inhaled their perfume. His eyes closed,
and he murmured: "Flowers, flowers, how beautiful is Nature!"
These were his last words.</p>


<h3>THE OLD MAN AND THE FLOWERS.</h3>

<p>A few years since the Belfast (Me.) <i>Journal</i> gave this touching
incident: "One day last week an elderly man, known to our people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
as an honest and hard-working citizen, was walking slowly up Main
street. There was sorrow in his countenance, and the shadow of
grief upon his face. Opposite the Savings Bank his eye caught
sight of the flowering Oleander, that with other plants fill the bay-window
of the banking-room. He looked at it long and wistfully.
At length he pushed open the door, and approaching Mr. Q., said:</p>

<p>"'Will you give me a few of those flowers?'</p>

<p>"The cashier, leaving the counting of money and the computing
of interest, came around the counter, bent down the plant, cut off
a cluster of blossoms, and placed it in the man's toil-hardened hand.
His curiosity led him to ask:</p>

<p>"'What do you want them for?'</p>

<p>"'My little granddaughter died of scarlet fever last night,' the
man replied with faltering voice, 'and I want to put them in her
coffin.'</p>

<p>"Blessed be flowers, that can thus solace the bereavement of
death and lend their brightness as a bloom, to the last resting-place
of the loved one."</p>


<h3>CONVERTED BY A FLOWER.</h3>

<p>There is a beautiful incident told of a Texas gentleman who was
an unbeliever in the Christian religion. One day he was walking
in the woods, reading the writings of Plato. He came to where
the great writer uses the phrase, "God geometrizes." He thought
to himself, "If I could only see plan and order in God's works, I
could be a believer." Just then he saw a little Texas Star at his
feet. He picked it up and then thoughtlessly began to count its
petals. He found there were five. He counted the stamens, and
there were five of them. He counted the divisions at the base of
the flower, there were five of them. He then set about multiplying
these three fives to see how many chances there were of a flower
being brought into existence without the aid of mind, and having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
in it these three fives. The chances against it were one hundred
and twenty-five to one. He thought that was very strange. He
examined another flower, and found it the same. He multiplied
one hundred and twenty-five by itself, to see how many chances
there were against there being two flowers, each having these exact
relations of numbers. He found the chances against it were
thirteen thousand six hundred and twenty-five to one. But all
around him were multitudes of these little flowers, and they had
been growing and blooming there for years. He thought this
showed the order of intelligence, and that the mind that ordained
it was God. And so he shut up his book, picked up the little
flower, kissed it, and exclaimed: "<i>Bloom on little flowers; sing on
little birds; you have a God, and I have a God; the God that made
these little flowers made me</i>."</p>

<span class="hidden">T</span>HIS species is one of the most desirable of hardy-wooded
plants we possess. They are admirable for the house, for
the balcony, the piazza, or the border, being handsome in
foliage, and very graceful and beautiful in flowers. Some
are stately, others dwarf, some are flexible and drooping. We have
had for several years three that we have greatly admired for their
variegated leaves, especially for the winter window-garden, where
they compensate for the scarcity of flowers, by the brilliancy of
their foliage, yellow and green, finely mottled and marbled.</p>

<p><i>Duc de Malakoff</i> is stately, and by cutting off the top of the
main stalk, it is made to branch out very largely, forming a miniature
tree. It grows very rapidly, and its leaves are like the Maple
in form, which has led many to call the plant Flowering Maple, but
this is not correct, as it is not a Maple at all, but an Abutilon.
Some of the leaves on one only a year old, measure seven inches
across, and eight and a half in length. In the older plant they
are not so large. <i>Thomsonii</i> much resembles <i>Malakoff</i>, but its
markings are not so handsome; the green is darker, and predominates
over the yellow, so far as my observation extends, but it is a
more abundant bloomer. Flowers are orange color. I have vainly
searched through many catalogues to find the color of the <i>Duc de
Malakoff</i> blossom, but all are silent; it is not even said that they
flower at all, but my four-year-old had one bud last year, which unfortunately
blighted. The yearling has one bud, and I hope it will
live and afford me the knowledge I have failed to find in books.
<i>Malakoff</i> not variegated, has large orange bells, striped with brown.</p>

<p>My other variegated Abutilons are of trailing habit; <i>Mesopotamicum</i>
is very graceful, one droops over the side, and climbs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
twines around the cords of a large hanging-pot, for which it is admirably
adapted. Its small pendant blossoms, crimson and yellow,
growing profusely along the slender branches, drooping among the
elegantly marbled foliage, give this variety a very attractive charm.
Another is trained to a pot trellis, and is very beautiful in this
form. We advise every one to add this variety to their collection.
<i>Pictum</i> is very similar in every respect; the leaves are darker, and
not so variegated. They require a strong light to bring out their
markings, and hence are more perfect in beauty when bedded out
in the garden, where they can have plenty of sunshine.</p>

<p><i>Boule de Neige</i> (Fairy Bell) has long been a favorite for its pure
white bells and constancy of bloom. A splendid winter bloomer.
<i>John Hopkins</i>, with its rich, dark, glossy leaves and golden flowers
has superseded the old <i>Pearl d'Or</i>, which was for a time the only
real yellow. <i>Darwinii</i> is one of my favorites. The flowers are
more spreading than any other variety, opening like a parasol;
color orange-scarlet veined with pink. It blossoms very profusely,
and when only a few inches in height. The flowers are large and
well formed, and borne in clusters rather than singly, like many
older sorts. This variety was cross-fertilized with <i>Santana</i>, crimson
flower, and as a result we have <i>Darwinii tessellatum</i>, combining
the variegated foliage of Thomsonii with the free-blooming qualities
of <i>Darwinii</i>.</p>

<p>The improvements by hybridizing have been very great within a
few years, and many new varieties have been sent out. One of
these is <i>Roseum Superbum</i>, the flowers of which are of a rich rose
color, veined with a delicate pink. Very free bloomer. <i>Venosum</i>,
we find only named in an English catalogue. "The magnificent
blooms of this variety place it at the top of all the Abutilons. Although
it is of tall growth its beautiful palm-shaped leaves and gorgeous
flowers make it invaluable for crossing and for conservatories."&mdash;<i>H.
Cannell.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the new and valuable novelties of American origin are
<i>Arthur Belsham</i>, <i>Robert George</i>, <i>J. H. Skinner</i>, and <i>Joseph Hill</i>.
These have been three years before the public, and Mr. John
Thorp, a well-known popular florist of Queens, N. Y., says of them,
"We have not, amongst all the flowering Abutilons, such fine varieties
as these. I have had plants between five and six feet high,
pyramidal shape and literally covered with flowers."</p>

<p>They originated with Messrs. Leeds &amp; Co., of Richmond, Indiana,
who make quite a specialty of new seedling Abutilons, and
this year offer four "of new shades and colors."</p>

<p><i>A. G. Porter.</i> "Flowers of a beautiful lavender color, delicately
suffused with a light shade of rosy pink, and handsomely veined
with magenta, forming a flower of magnificent color and shape, a
very free bloomer. A cross between <i>Boule de Neige</i> and <i>Rosaflora</i>,
with the habit and growth of <i>Boule de Neige</i>."</p>

<p><i>Little Beauty</i>, "A very dwarf grower, having a short, compact,
symmetrical bush, which is completely covered with its medium-sized
but well-shaped flowers, of a very light salmon color, beautifully
veined with rosy carmine. It blooms in clusters and when in
full bloom makes a remarkably fine appearance. A cross between
<i>Rosaflora</i> and <i>Darwinii</i>."</p>

<p><i>N. B. Stover</i>, "A low, compact grower. Flowers large and well-formed,
almost covering the bush; color, rich ponceau, finely
veined with carmine. A decided novelty, being a new color among
Abutilons."</p>

<p><i>Dr. Rapples.</i> "Light orange salmon, veined with crimson. One
of the most attractive in the set."</p>

<p>A new Abutilon, a decided novelty in color, comes to us from
"The Home for Flowers," Swanley, England, sent with other
choice plants by Henry Cannell &amp; Son. It is thus described in
his <i>Floral Guide:</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Firefly</span> (Swanley Red). By far the highest and brightest color<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of all the family; habit dwarf, and one of the freest bloomers, throwing
flowers out on strong foot stalks of the finest shape; certainly
one of the noblest, and when grown in a pot it flowers all the winter,
and all the summer when planted out, and forms one of the best
flowering shrubs that we possess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parentage of this Flower.</span>&mdash;Mr. George states that he sometime
since flowered a small red variety, which had a very lively
shade of color, and determining to make this a seed parent, it occurred
to him to use on it the pollen of the single deep color Hibiscas,
which, like the Abutilon, is included in the natural order
<i>Malvaceæ</i>. Mr. George thinks the fine color seen in his new variety,
<i>Firefly</i>, is due to this happy inspiration of color.</p>

<p>The <i>Gardener's Chronicle</i> has this paragraph respecting Firefly:
A red Abutilon, one of a batch of recent seedlings raised by Mr. J.
George of Putney Heath, well deserves the foregoing appellation.
The flowers are of large size and of a much greater depth and vividness
of color than that possessed by any variety in the Chiswick
collection. It has been provisionally named Firefly, and we believe
the stock has passed into the hands of H. Cannell &amp; Son, of Swanley,
for distribution.</p>

<p>A writer in <i>Vick's Magazine</i> describes a method of training the
Abutilon that must, we think, be a very attractive one.</p>

<p>"A pretty plant may be obtained by inarching Abutilon Mesopotamicum
upon <i>Abutilon Darwinii</i>, or some other strong-growing
variety, and training it so as form an umbrella head, which can easily
be done. The stock for this purpose should be about five or
six feet high. Grown in this way it produces an abundance of
bloom, and the flowers being elevated are seen in all their beauty.
If <i>Abutilon Mesopotamicum</i> is inarched upon <i>Abutilon Thompsonii</i>,
the result will be <i>Abutilon Mesopotamicum Variegatum</i>. A well-formed
plant of this on a stock about five feet high is one of the
finest of plants; whether in blossom or not it is always adapted for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
decorative or exhibition purposes. Care must be taken at all times
to keep them tied to stakes, as they are liable to be broken off by
the wind."</p>

<p>Abutilons are apt to be infested by the red spider, if kept in too
dry an atmosphere, and not frequently sprayed. Moisture is death
to this pest, but as it makes its home on the under side of the leaf,
it is too often overlooked until it has destroyed the vitality of the
foliage. Recently I found that my large <i>Duc de Malakoff</i> looked
sickly, and I concluded it had become root-bound. A few days
later, I noticed brown spots thickly covering the bark. I removed
one, and on examining the under side through a microscope, I saw
several tiny insects moving about. I decided that my plant was
troubled with the scale of which I had often read, but never seen.
I made a pretty strong solution of soap-suds, and with a sponge
quite easily removed all of the pests.</p>

<p>In bedding out Abutilons, it is better to have them in pots, plugging
the hole, or setting the pot on a stone or piece of brick, so
that the roots may not go astray, for if plunged directly in the
ground they throw out many roots and the plant becomes too large
for re-potting to advantage. If, however, they are planted in the
earth, in August they should be cut around the stock so as to
bring the roots within due bounds, and the plant can be pruned
in the autumn. This method is applicable to all strong plants that
run largely to roots. They should be cut off sufficiently to leave
only a ball of earth of convenient size to set in the pot when the
plant is transplanted.</p>

<img src="images/i_129a2.jpg" alt="Dahlias." height="40" width="124" />

<p><img src="images/i_129b.jpg" class="dropcap" alt="T" title="T" height="95" width="55" />
<span class="hidden">T</span>HE genus Dahlia comprises but few species, all natives of
the mountains of Mexico, whose range is from 5000 to
10,000 feet above the level of the sea. About one hundred
years ago a Spanish botanist introduced seeds of the Dahlia
into his native country, and named the genus in honor of a Swedish
botanist, <span class="smcap">Dahl</span>. The first seed imported seemed to be variable
and not very promising. About seventy years since, <span class="smcap">Humboldt</span>
sent fresh seed to Germany. Soon after this, both seeds and bulbs
were introduced into England and France, and began to attract
considerable attention, some enthusiast being rash enough to hazard
the assertion that "there are considerable reasons for thinking
that the Dahlia will hereafter be raised with double flowers."</p>

<p>About 1812 probably the first double Dahlia was grown, but for
several years after this both double and single varieties were figured
in colored plates, and exhibited at horticultural shows. That the
single varieties were prized is not strange, for the double were not
very good, and even as late as 1818, published figures showed very
imperfect flowers.</p>

<p>The improvement of the Dahlia after this was rapid, and its popularity
quite kept pace with its improvement. Dahlia exhibitions
were held in England and on the continent, which were crowded
by enthusiastic admirers of this wonderful Mexican flower. For
many years the Dahlia maintained its popularity, but there is a
fashion in flowers, as in almost everything, and for a time the Dahlia
became, to a certain extent, unfashionable, and this was well; for
it placed the flower upon merit alone, and growers were compelled
to introduce new and superior varieties to command either attention
or sale for their favorite flower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>A taste for old styles is now the "correct thing," and so we have
imitations of ancient earthenware, furniture, etc., and import <i>original</i>
Chinese Aster seed, and also obtain roots of the single Dahlia
from Mexico.</p>

<p>There are three pretty distinct classes, the <i>Show</i> Dahlias, the
Dwarf or Bedding, and the <i>Pompon</i> or Bouquet, and to this we may
add the <i>Fancy</i> Dahlia. The <i>Show Dahlia</i> grows from three to four
feet in height, and embraces all our finest sorts, fit for exhibition
at horticultural shows, from which the name is derived; the flowers
range in size from two and a half to five inches in diameter. The
striped and mottled and spotted varieties belonging to the Show
section are called <i>Fancy</i>, and though not as rich, nor usually as
highly prized as the selfs, or those of one color, are very attractive.
The <i>Dwarf</i> or <i>Bedding Dahlia</i> grows about eighteen inches in
height, and makes a thick, compact bush, and covers a good deal
of surface; flowers of the size of Show Dahlias. They are therefore
very desirable for bedding and massing. The <i>Pompon</i> or <i>Bouquet
Dahlia</i> makes a pretty, compact plant, about three feet in
height. The leaves are small, and the flowers from one to two
inches in diameter. Many expect to find small flowers on their
Dwarf Dahlias, and feel disappointed because they are of the ordinary
size, not knowing that it is the plant, and not the flower, that
is dwarfed, and that only the Pompon gives the small flowers.
The word <i>Pompon</i> is French for topknot or trinket, meaning about
the same as the English word cockade. The English term <i>Bouquet</i>
is very appropriate, as the flowers are so small they are very suitable
for bouquets. Being of a spreading habit, they cover a good
deal of ground. Unlike most of our bedding out plants, they do
best in a poor soil; if rich, they grow to branches and leaves so
much, they bloom sparingly and late.</p>

<p>Generally those who plant Dahlias purchase the tuberous roots,
because they give good strong plants, that flower freely without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
trouble or risk. They are smaller and better than the large, coarse
roots usually grown, because they are raised from cuttings, and
generally form their roots in pots. When a tuber is planted, a
number of buds that cluster around its top will push and form
shoots, and if too numerous, a portion should be removed; indeed,
one good, strong plant will suffice, and then the plant will become
a tree instead of a bush. Even then, if the top become too thick,
a little thinning of the branches will be of advantage. If the young
shoots that start from the neck of the bulb, are cut off near a joint
and placed in a hot-bed in sandy soil, they will root, form good
plants, and flower quite as well as plants grown from the tuber;
this, however, requires some care and experience, and amateurs
generally will succeed best with bulbs.</p>

<p>New varieties of Dahlias, of course, are from seed. Some of
them prove good, others fair, and a portion utterly worthless. As
a general rule, we would not advise amateurs to trouble with seeds,
although there is pleasure in watching the birth and development
of a new and beautiful variety.</p>

<p>The seed of Dahlias may be sown in pots in early spring or end
of winter, in a light, loamy soil; they will germinate quickly, and
as soon as they begin to show their second leaves they should be
pricked out into other pots or boxes, so that they may have plenty
of room and air&mdash;they are very liable to damp off if at all crowded.
After pricking out they should be kept in a thrifty, growing condition,
by proper attention to watering and temperature; the temperature
should be maintained as near 70° as possible, and the watering
be sufficient to preserve a moderate moisture.</p>

<p>If the green fly attack them, it will be best to treat them to a
very weak dilution of tobacco water; the young succulent plants
are very sensitive to smoke, and it is best not to fumigate them.
In about two months the young plants should be large enough to
pot off singly, or to be transplanted into a frame or bed, where protection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
can be given them from the cold of night-time, or from late
frosts. As soon as all danger is past they can be transplanted into
their summer quarters, and should stand at least three feet
apart. The soil where they are to grow, should be rich and mellow.
In August they will come into flower, and those having blooms
worthy of cultivation can be retained, and the others destroyed.
Only a small proportion of the plants grown from common seed
produce flowers equal to those now in cultivation, but when seed is
saved from a choice collection of named varieties, the chances are
that a large proportion of the plants will produce very good flowers.&mdash;<i>Vick's
Magazine.</i></p>

<p>"The Dahlia is called a <i>gross feeder</i>, but it is not. It loves
moisture rather than rich elemental food. In clay it finds the best
constituents of its development&mdash;moisture, silex, lime and alumnia.
So we say to those who love this queenly flower, if you would see
the queen in all her glory, plant in a comparatively heavy soil, no
manure, and reduce the stalks to one for each tuber, set the stakes
firmly, to keep the stalks from swaying, and if the season is dry,
give the bulbs a <i>soaking</i> with water every evening during the
drought. My word for it you will then be proud of your success."</p>

<p>The Pompon, or Bouquet Dahlia is a favorite variety of this genus.
The little round balls of bloom are so pretty and trim.

<h3>SINGLE DAHLIAS.</h3>

<p>Anything for a change from the common order of things, seems
to be the fashion now-a-days, in flowers as well as in house building
and house furnishing. The antique, the antique, is the rage!
So after years of labor and hybridization to bring the Dahlia up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
from its native state of single blessedness, to its enormous cauliflower
blooms, there comes a reaction, and now single Dahlias are
praised as "the most beautiful of all flowers," the "<i>par excellence</i>
the Londoner's flower!" Well, let the English florists thus praise
its beauty if they want to, but we opine that on this side of the
great ocean it will never be considered "the most beautiful of all
flowers," however attractive some of them may be, and well adapted
for bouquets. There is no danger of their superseding the
doubles, but it is well to have both when one can afford it; their
present high price puts them beyond the reach of those whose
purses are not well filled, but in a year or two, when the novelty is
worn off, they can be purchased at half or even less, perhaps, than
their present price.</p>

<p>We find in the London <i>Garden</i> the following: "Dahlia perfecta,
originally introduced by Messrs. Henderson, is perhaps the finest
flower which we possess, unless Paragon, brought into notice by
H. Cannell, may be considered to bear away the palm. Lutea, a
quilled yellow, is also a grand bouquet flower."</p>

<p>The single Dahlias, Paragon and Lutea, are now offered for the
first time in this country, by Messrs. Hallock &amp; Thorp of Queens,
N. Y., and the former is finely illustrated in their catalogue. Color
very dark velvety maroon with shadings of bright scarlet around
each petal; small yellow disk. Lutea is pure yellow, with dark
orange center. The same firm offer Dahlia Juarezii, of which Mr.
Cannell says: "The grandest novelty of the year, and not only a
novelty, but a most valuable and useful decorative plant for all purposes
through the late summer and autumn months. Its blossoms
are of a rich crimson, and very much resemble in shape and color
the well-known Cactus, Cereus <i>speciosissimus</i>. Height about three
feet, very bushy flowers of very striking appearance and quite unlike
those of an ordinary double Dahlia, the flowerets being flat
and not cupped. Figured in <i>Gardener's Chronicle</i> October 4th,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
1879, and awarded a Botanical Certificate Royal Horticultural
Society."</p>

<p>The following statement was made in the <i>Gardener's Chronicle</i>
respecting this new type:</p>

<p>"A remarkable box of Dahlias was shown by Messrs. Cannell
with three or four of the single forms, which, if it were not heresy
to say so, we should so much prefer to the formal lumps so dear to
the florist proper; and then there was a new type of Dahlia altogether,
a Sea Anemone among Dahlias, with long crimson scarlet
pointed petals, like the tentacles of an Antinia&mdash;a striking novelty,
christened temporarily the Cactus Dahlia, and which will be the
parent of a new strain. It received a Botanical Certificate; some
said this ought to have a higher award, but what higher or more
appropriate form of a certificate could be given to such a flower.
If we were a Dahlia, we should greatly prefer the honor of a 'Botanical,'
to that of a 'First Class Certificate.'"</p>

<p>This new type is illustrated in Hallock &amp; Thorp's Catalogue.</p>

<p>Two new Dahlias not yet introduced in this country are included
among the novelties of 1881. <i>Cannell's Scarlet</i>, a Show Dahlia,
several shades higher and brighter in color than any scarlet before
introduced. "Its shape is most model-like, and not excelled by
any other, and is without doubt the best Dahlia of the year." <i>Miss
Cannell</i>, (Eckford)&mdash;"Mr. Eckford's Dahlia, Memorial, was the king
of best shapes for many years, but the one now offered is of greater
excellence, and by far the best of its class; color white, tipped
with rose-pink, and the depth and build of flower is most model-like."</p>


<h3><a id="AMARYLLIS"></a>AMARYLLIS.</h3>

<p>These are the finest of all summer flowering bulbs, throwing up
strong flower stems in June and July, bearing from two to six magnificent
lily-like blossoms. The varieties are numerous, but only a
few sorts are found catalogued. Amaryllis Johnsonii is the finest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
of the commonly grown varieties. Its leaves are a dark rich green,
two inches broad, and two feet long. The flowers which are five
or six inches long, are crimson with a white stripe through the center
of each petal, and are borne upon a stalk two feet high. They
usually bloom twice a year, the flowers appearing just as the leaves
begin to grow.</p>

<p>Amaryllis formosissima is of a very peculiar form. The flowers
are scarlet-crimson, very velvety in appearance; there are six petals,
three of them nearly erect, and three drooping very long.
After being bedded out, it quickly throws up a flower stalk and
blooms before the leaves appear. It is a superb flower, known
sometimes by the name of Jacobean Lily. Amaryllis vittata is a
splendid hybrid, red ground striped with white. Amaryllis Valotta
purpurea is an evergreen variety, and should be kept growing the
year round. In August it throws up a flower-stem from one foot
to eighteen inches high, bearing a cluster of light scarlet flowers
two or three inches in diameter. A light soil and small pot suits
it best. Mr. John Lewis Child of Queens, N. Y., has a finer collection
and more numerous varieties than are usually found named in
the catalogues. Some of them we will specify. Johnsonii Grandiflora,
an improvement on the well-known Johnsonii Harrisoni,
large, pure white, with double crimson streaks running through
each petal. It has a delicious, orange-blossom fragrance. Reticulata,
a bright rose color, the foliage is very attractive&mdash;dark green
with a white stripe running through the center of each leaf. Aulica
Stenopelalon, a magnificent species, having large orange crimson
flowers, beautifully veined with scarlet. "Equestre fl. pl.
This grand novelty was discovered in 1877, in one of the West
India Islands. The flowers are perfectly double, resembling those
of a large Camellia. Its color is rich, fiery orange red. We believe
we have the only stock of this beautiful flower in America."
<span class="smcap">John L. Child.</span></p>

<p>This and Harrisoni, are priced at $4.50, so they must be very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
rare and beautiful. Aspasie, white, tinted with yellow and red;
large and perfect. Crinum Amænum, new and very beautiful,
white-striped crimson. Lutea, a hardy variety, which blooms in
the autumn; pure yellow. Calafornica, pure white.</p>

<p>The bulbs are of easy culture. After blooming, and the foliage
fully grown, they should be allowed to rest for several months,
then start into growth by watering sparingly until the flower stalks
appear, when a more liberal supply should be given. Usually two
successions of bloom can thus be obtained. The bulb should be
planted so as to leave the upper portion uncovered.</p>


<h3><a id="HOYA_CARNOSA_OR_WAX_PLANT"></a>HOYA CARNOSA, OR WAX PLANT.</h3>

<p>This plant is a native of tropical Asia, where it is partially parasitical,
its roots penetrating the bark of the trees which support it.
It was introduced into England in 1802. There are several species,
but only one is generally cultivated. Hoya Carnosa has
thick waxy leaves, and bears umbels of beautiful flesh-colored
flowers which are very wax-like in appearance. It is an excellent
plant for house culture as it stands the extremes of heat and cold
better than most plants, and is not easily injured by neglect. It
can be trained to climb on trellis-work to almost any height, and
when in bloom, which continues for half the year, it is a very interesting
plant.</p>

<p>There are several varieties of Hoya, but one only is generally
cultivated. <i>Silver Variegated Foliage</i> is said to be very handsome
but is of slow growth and difficult to propagate. <i>Imperialis</i> is a
new variety with beautiful foliage and scarlet flowers. <i>Cunningham</i>
has light green leaves, deeper colored flowers than the Carnosa
and is a rapid grower.</p>

<p>They succeed best in peat, with some fibrous soil and sand.
They must have perfect drainage, and require a period of rest.
Hoya Carnosa is easily propagated from cuttings. A very good
method is to wrap a cutting in moss, keeping it moist until the
roots are well started.</p>

<span class="hidden">A</span>UGUST is the month when we rest from our labor in gardening,
and abandon ourselves to the full enjoyment of the
varied blossoms which so abundantly meet our eye. Now
we can best determine what changes may be required in
the arrangement of our plants next year, in order to give the most
pleasing effect. A tall plant may have been inadvertently set out
in the midst of those of low growth, and we see now how awkward
it looks. Short-lived annuals may have occupied a conspicuous
place, and on their departure left an unseemly vacancy. A bed
may have been filled with a class of plants that are not free bloomers,
and so there has been little beside leaves, while another bed
has been brilliant during all the summer months with flowers.
Annuals of a new kind, high-priced novelties, have been tested;
are they any better than our old favorites? If we cannot indulge
in many sorts, what do we find the most satisfactory? Twenty-five
cents per packet seemed very expensive for Heddewigii Pinks, but
Crimson Belle and Eastern Queen are of such superior size and
rare beauty that the investment is not regretted, and then we know
that they will bloom in greater perfection next year, and that the
seed saved this autumn and sown in early spring, will increase the
stock. Twenty-five cents for a paper of Candytuft seed looks extravagant,
but no one who invests in Tom Thumb would regret it.
It is so dwarf, so compact and bushy, such a long continued bloomer,
so admirable for edging a bed, that it is really almost an essential.
Then it will sow itself, and the seedlings will be up as soon
as the frost is out of the ground, and plants from self-sown seed
are so much more thrifty and early than those one sows in the
spring, that this is a great gain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Candytuft&mdash;white, pink, light purple, dark purple and crimson, I
find it well worth while to culture for early and profuse flowers,
and admirably adapted for bouquets. I always have large quantities
of the white, to set off the brighter flowers, and by sowing seed
in June and July, have a succession of blooming plants. Foxglove,
both white and purple, with their thimble-shaped spotted blossoms
profusely borne on tall spikes, with side branches loaded with
bloom, has been one of the greatly admired flowers of my garden.
Plumbago, with its clusters of tube flowers, of the palest of blue, is
very beautiful. Godetia, "Lady Albemarle," I have found to be
all that it is represented. For two months it has been in constant
bloom, and it will continue to flower till frost. It is of a bushy, compact
habit, about twelve inches high, the flowers are from three to four
inches in diameter, and of a rosy-carmine color. Everybody who
has seen it, has a word of praise for this most beautiful of all the
Godetias. <i>Alba</i> is a new variety, having pure white flowers; <i>Insignis</i>
is pure white with a crimson blotch on each petal; <i>Whitney's</i>
is of dwarf habit, and has large flowers, blush-colored, marked about
the center with a handsome crimson stain. The new French Marigolds
"Cloth of Gold," and "Meteor" are just splendid with their
large and beautifully striped imbricated leaves. One has gold bars
evenly marked on the rich dark velvety petals, and the other has
deep orange stripes on a pale straw-colored, almost white ground.
"Meteor" is a perfect gem among the Calendulas.</p>

<p>Convolvulus minor&mdash;new crimson-violet with yellow eye encircled
with a band of pure white; dark blue and light blue with yellow
eye margined with white; pure white with yellow eye, and
blue and white striped, are very pretty free-blooming dwarfs of this
species.</p>

<p>My Stocks are very fine, from mixed seed of the German, new
large flowering. They are mostly very double. The creamy white
are especially beautiful. The bright crimson and canary yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
are handsome. There are many varieties of this species, but what
are generally termed Ten-weeks Stock are best known. They are
classed under five heads: Dwarf, Miniature, Large-flowered, Pyramidal
and Wall-flower-leaved. Then there are the Intermediate
Stocks, prized for their late autumn blooming, of which there are
twelve or more varieties. The German Brompton Stocks are divided
into two sections; Brompton and Hybrid, or Cocordean. The
latter bloom with a single stem which forms a splendid pyramid of
flowers, and is cultivated largely in pots. Seeds sown in early
spring will bloom in autumn, and if carefully potted will flower
during winter; if sown in July and August, and cultivated in pots
will flower the following spring and summer. The Imperial or
Emperor stocks, sometimes called Perpetual, are large flowering,
and white, rose, crimson and blood-red in color.</p>

<p>"Hardy's All-the-Year-Round," is a perpetual bloomer. The
plants grow about twelve inches high, and produce hundreds of
bunches of double white flowers.</p>

<p>Let us linger a little while at this rose bed. Are not those Teas
lovely? Look at Madame Lambard, one of the finest French roses
imported recently from Paris. Is not the color exquisite&mdash;a beautiful
shade of silver bronze, changing to salmon and fawn, delicately
shaded with carmine rose. And so deliciously fragrant! That
rose so large and full, with a rare shade of violet red, brightened
with crimson maroon, is Aline Sisley. It is surprising how such a
tiny plant could have produced such an immense flower! And
this is Letty Coles, a new French rose, very handsome and sweet;
color rosy-pink, deeply shaded with intense crimson. Perle des
Jardins is magnificent with its rich golden yellow, and Bon Silene
has long been a special favorite. Its buds are large and beautiful.
That charming white so deliciously scented is Mademoiselle Rachel,
and this one with pure deep green flowers is Verdiflora, or Green
Rose, scentless, and of no value except as a curiosity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>This grand rose is Abel Carriere, a hybrid perpetual more beautiful
I think than the popular Jacqueminot in the perfectness of its
form, and richness of its color. The outer petals are bright glowing
crimson-scarlet, while the center is a deep fiery red. But it
will never do to linger longer among the sweet roses, for there are
many other flowers to show you.</p>

<p>I think that Hydrangea, with its immense trusses of bloom, is
just one of the most desirable shrubs we can have in the garden.
I have had mine six or seven years, and it bore three clusters of
flowers the first year, though a wee plant. It blooms from August
till hard frost, and needs no protection in the winter, though
I do sometimes put a mulching of straw or a bit of brush around
the roots. A lady writing to <i>Vick's Magazine</i> says of this Hydrangea:
"The first year I planted <i>Hydrangea Grandiflora</i> it produced
three heads of flowers, the second, fifty-six, and the third year
ninety-two. Thorough cultivation and a pail of liquid manure
once a week, helped the plant to bear this enormous load of
flowers."</p>

<p>Hydrangea <i>Alaska</i> is a more recent acquisition. Its flowers frequently
measure twelve inches across, and are of a bright pink color,
not hardy at the North. <i>Hydrangea Thomas Hogg</i> would be a very
unpoetical name did it not remind one of "The Ettrick Shepherd."
This variety was sent to the United States from Japan, by that
eminent botanist for whom it is named, and has become deservedly
popular. It belongs to the Hortensia section of the family, but is
a far more abundant bloomer than any other. The flowers are of
the purest white, of very firm texture, and retain their beauty for a
long time.</p>

<p>A more recent novelty sent from Japan by Mr. Hogg, is the
"New Climbing Hydrangea," which he describes as clinging to
trees to the height of fifty feet, producing corymbs of white flowers
of the size of ordinary Hydrangeas. It clings exactly like the Ivy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and must produce a striking effect when in full bloom. It is entirely
hardy. Mr. Peter Henderson was the first to offer this novelty
here and in Europe. <i>Elegantissima</i> is a novelty truly with its
leaves flaked, bordered and striped with golden yellow. I do not
know whether it blossoms or not, it is handsome enough without
flowers.</p>


<h3>HELIOTROPE.</h3>

<p>The new Heliotrope <i>Le Negre</i> is
the darkest of this genus, and <i>Snow
Wreath</i> the nearest approach to
white we have yet had; truss very
large, growth compact, and fragrance
exquisite. <i>Garibaldi</i> is almost white;
<i>Mrs. Burgess</i> is dark violet, and <i>Duc
de Lavendury</i> is a rich blue, dark eye.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_141.jpg" width="266" height="300" alt="Heliotrope" />
</div>

<p>Sweet Alyssum is another of the
essential flowers for the border, admirable
for edgings, for its dwarf
habit and continuity of bloom. The great novelty of last year was
the new double variegated Sweet Alyssum&mdash;"The Gem." The
flowers are very full, and the foliage broad with a mid-rib of light
green, bordered on each side with pure white. It is a fine, compact
grower, and far superior to anything of this species yet offered.</p>

<p>Lantanas, I think, add greatly to the attractions of the garden,
so rich in color and profuse in blooming. <i>Clotilda</i>, pink with yellow
center, and <i>Comtesse de Diencourt</i>, flower bright rose and yellow
center sulphur, are very desirable. <i>Alba perfecta</i>, pure white, is
fine, so also is <i>Alba lutea grandiflora</i>, white with yellow center.
<i>Mine d'Or</i> is a new variety, with bright orange and crimson flowers,
and golden variegated foliage. <i>M. Schmidt</i> is a beautiful
novelty. Flowers of a brilliant yellow, passing into purple vermilion;
grows in the style of a Petunia.</p>

<span class="hidden">N</span>EXT to Primroses, and by no means below them in value,
we place the Cyclamen. The leaves, a deep green with
white embroidery, are very ornamental, but when surmounted
with a wealth of bloom, what can be more charming?
Two of mine have begun to blossom&mdash;a white and a pink&mdash;and
the buds are numerous. Others will bloom later. They continue
in bloom for a long period, and are easy of culture, though
where there is over-dryness of atmosphere, they are apt to be infested
with the red spider. They need to be frequently sprayed
and it is well to immerse occasionally the entire plant in water so
as to wet the under surface of the leaves. The water ought to be
tepid, and indeed for all plants in cold weather. To keep the dirt
from falling out when the plant is plunged top downward, something
can be wrapped around the pot. A mixture of turfy loam
and sandy peat is best, but when not available, leaf mold or a rich
mellow soil mixed with silver sand will do.</p>

<p>There are several varieties of Cyclamen, but the most common
is <i>persicum</i>, and many catalogues name no other. One of mine is
<i>gigantium</i>, an improvement on <i>persicum</i>, the flowers being much
larger and finer in every respect. Among many catalogues I find
this named in only one. <i>Persicum</i>, white and pink, is a sweet
scented variety from Cyprus; <i>Africanum</i>, white and rose, from
Africa; <i>hederæfolium</i>, from Britain. Other rare and expensive
sorts are <i>Atkinsii</i>, white, crimson and rose colored; <i>Europeum</i>, red,
and <i>Coum</i>, which in the early spring months bears above its very
ornamental leaves "a profusion of small bright, rosy, crimson and
snow-white turbinate blossoms of a roundish recurved outline,
blotched with violet-crimson at the base, very beautiful."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>The bulbs of all Cyclamens, except <i>Coum</i>, should be placed on
the surface of the soil, covered half an inch, and water given moderately
till the leaves are fully developed, and the flowers appear,
when it may be applied more liberally. Do not make a mistake
and plant your bulb upside down as did a lady I know of. "I have
an idea that it is put in wrong, as the leaves seem to come from
the under side," she writes. It is difficult to tell sometimes which
is the right side to put down.</p>

<p><i>Persicum</i>, with its dappled green and silvery gray, rounded, heart-shaped
leaves, embroidered margins, is a fine ornament, but when
these are surmounted with a profusion of pure silvery white oblong
lanceolate petals, blotched with violet-crimson at their base, borne
on slender flower-scopes, the plant is very beautiful. It varies in
color from snow-white delicate peach and rosy crimson. Some are
delightfully fragrant. During the growing and flowering season
the plant should have a full exposure to the light, but not to the
intense sunshine. After blooming, the bulbs may be allowed a
time of rest, removing them to a cool and shady place in the border,
if desired, watering rarely. In early autumn repot, and after a
few weeks of growth, water more freely. It does not, however, injure
the plant to keep it constantly growing, and the best florists
have very generally abandoned their former method of letting them
rest during the summer. <i>Cyclamen autumnale flore alba</i>, white,
and <i>rubra</i>, red, blossom in the autumn.</p>


<h3>OXALIS.</h3>

<p>The winter blooming varieties are admirably adapted for hanging-pots,
and being cheap and very easy of cultivation, they ought
to be in every dwelling. There are one hundred and fifty known
varieties, though our catalogues rarely name half-a-dozen. Some
are strictly winter bloomers, others flower only in summer, and
some blossom the year round. The <i>floribunda</i> varieties belong to
this class of perpetuals. <i>Ortgiesi</i> also, which is a wonderful bloomer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and on account of its erect growth, is admirably adapted for pot
culture. It is a new and somewhat rare species from Brazil. It
often grows eighteen inches high, and in good form. The upper
side of the leaf is rich olive green, and the under side bright violet
purple. The flowers are quite small, yellow, and borne in clusters.
The special beauty is in the foliage.</p>

<p><i>Floribunda alba</i> and <i>rosea</i> have tuberous roots. The foliage is
very strong, and the clusters of bloom are borne on long foot-stalks
starting directly from the tuber. A single small tuber will often
have a hundred open flowers at a time. They are from one-half to
three-quarters of an inch in diameter. This variety can be obtained
and planted at any time of the year. It is admirably adapted
for baskets or a hanging-pot.</p>

<p><i>Oxalis acetocella</i> is the true shamrock of Ireland. Flowers are
white, borne on stalks two to four inches high. <i>Versicolor</i> is a winter
bloomer; color white, with bright pink margins to the petals;
requires sunshine; the flowers will not expand in cloudy weather.
<i>Floribunda</i> has no such freaks, but smiles in the storm, as well as
the sunshine. A lady writing to Mr. Vick becomes enthusiastic
over her Oxalis. She says: "The sixth of last October I planted
a bulb of <i>Oxalis versicolor</i>, and it is just beginning to bloom. And
oh! what lovely flowers; delicate and perfect in form, pure white,
with just the faintest tinge of yellow in the center, and beautiful
crimson stripes on the outside. The plant also is of a very graceful
habit, bearing its tuft of small leaves, and clusters of flowers on
the top of a short, slender stem. It seems strange that so small a
bulb can produce such beautiful flowers."</p>

<p>Of <i>Bowii</i> she thus writes: "A year ago last October I planted
a bulb of <i>Oxalis Bowii</i> in a small bed. The bulb was so very
small that I did not believe the flowers could amount to much, but
was soon most agreeably disappointed. Such a mass of flowers on
one small plant I had never seen before, and such large, bright-colored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
flowers! Many stopped to admire it, and ask its name. It
continued to produce a mass of flowers the entire winter and part
of the spring, until the sun became very hot. From this one bulb
I obtained eight, which I wrapped in paper and kept in a dry place.
About the first of August they commenced growing, and so I
planted them, and the first of September they were in full bloom,
though the flower grew large as the days became less hot, until
they were nearly as large as Petunias. The soil in which they
grew was mostly sand and rich surface earth from the woods, and
I sometimes watered them with weak soap-suds."</p>

<p>Mr. Vick, to whom we are indebted for the most of our information
on this subject, says that this variety has large, thick, fleshy
leaves, and large, bright, rose-colored flowers, the largest, indeed,
of any of the cultivated kinds.</p>

<p>In his illustrated article he gives an engraving of one named
<i>Cernuus plena</i>, the flowers of which resemble double Portulacas;
erect, borne in clusters. We regret that he gives no reference to
this variety whatever. It must be a rare sort, probably not in the
market here.</p>

<h3>"CONSIDER THE LILIES."</h3>

<p><img src="images/i_146b.jpg" class="dropcap" alt="T" title="T" height="95" width="54" />
<span class="hidden">T</span>HUS spake one wiser than Solomon, even He whose hand
created and beautified the Lilies with a glory surpassing
that of the greatest of Israel's kings.</p>

<p>This department of the Floral kingdom is too vast for us
to explore; we can only make a selection of a few of the numerous
varieties for consideration, gathering our information from the various
sources at hand, and adapting it to our present use.</p>

<p>The Lily is the rival of the Rose, and by many is considered
far superior. They certainly are far more easily cultivated. They
are hardy, elegant, gorgeous sometimes, and sometimes of snowy
purity. Many of them are of exquisite fragrance. There are early
and late bloomers, and one can have these desirable flowers in succession
for several months, by a right selection. The earliest
bloomers are the <i>Pomponiums</i>, natives of Siberia, and are perfectly
hardy. The <i>Lancifolium</i> or <i>Speciosum</i> is the autumn blooming Lily,
native of Japan. <i>Lancifolium Album</i>, a fine sort, with pure white
petals and a pea-green stripe, very fragrant. <i>Lancifolium Rubrum</i>,
and <i>Roseum</i>, though catalogued separately, are the same with different
shadings. Some purplish crimson, others a faint blush of
rose. Some have a red stripe, others a dark dull green, but all are
specially recommended. <i>Lancifolium Punctatum verum</i> is a late
bloomer; color, clear white with soft rose spots and green stripes.
Finest of the species, <i>Lancifolium Praecox;</i> flowers white with a
purplish-blush at the tips. <i>Lancifolium Monstrosum</i> or <i>Corymbiflorum
rubrum</i>, bears its crimson flowers in large clusters. Grows
to a great size.</p>

<p>The Lancifolium Lilies are of special value for their hardiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
and varied beauty, and their cheapness places them within general
reach. They are classed under the head of <span class="smcap">Martagons</span>, or <span class="smcap">Turks
Cap</span>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 271px;">
<img src="images/i_147.jpg" width="271" height="300" alt="Lily" />
</div>

<p><i>Auratum Imperial</i> is the Golden-banded-Lily
of Japan which has become so extensively
known and popular since its introduction
from Japan by Mr. Gordon Dexter.
It was first exhibited in July 1862, at the
Massachusetts Horticultural Exhibition.
It first bloomed in England same year. It
was for sometime considered too tender
for the Canadas and New England states,
but it proved to be hardy. We have had ours twelve years, and
give it only a slight protection. The petals of the Auratum are
snowy white with a golden band running down the center of each,
and freely spotted on the sides with deep carmine red. They are
very fragrant. Being of somewhat slender growth, they need support.
It does best in a warm sandy soil that has been well manured
and dug deeply. It is easily propagated from the scales of the bulbs,
each scale producing a small bulbet. They should be planted in a box
about a foot deep, in good friable soil about three inches deep, and
one inch apart. Sink the box in some out of the way place in the
garden, and water frequently. In a short time small bulbs will be
found forming on the base, which rapidly grow, and must be transplanted
out the second year in the bed; the third or fourth year it
will bloom. The little bulbets which form on the mother bulb
blossom a year earlier. They should be renewed in the fall, after
the foliage is dead. Plant in a bed about four inches deep, and let
them remain undisturbed for two years; then they are large enough
to bloom and should be transplanted into a permanent bed, if required.</p>

<h3>LONGIFLORUM LILIES.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 197px;">
<img src="images/i_148.jpg" width="197" height="300" alt="Longiflorum Lily" />
</div>

<p>These trumpet-shaped Lilies are
charming in appearance, quite hardy
and fragrant. They bloom in
July or August, and continue in
beauty for a long time.</p>

<p>Longiflorum <i>Japonicum</i> blooms
in July, and is a fine dwarf bedder;
color pure white, with occasionally
a greenish tinge outside. Increases
rapidly. <i>Eximium</i> bears a
longer flower, from six to nine inches
in length, and is more open at
the mouth than the common Longiflorum.
Pure white and very fragrant.
<i>Brownii</i> is a native of Japan,
and is a grand Lily of rare
beauty. It resembles Longiflorum in shape, but is larger and more
expanding; color white inside, exterior brownish-purple; stamens
rich chocolate, which forms a distinctive feature in this species. It
has been frequently confounded with <i>Japonicum</i>, but the difference
is very marked in the illustrations of the two, and are thus noted
in Messrs. Hallock &amp; Thorp's "Catalogue of Lilies."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Japonicum</span> (<i>Odorum, Japonicum Colchesterii</i>). One of the most
beautiful and rarest Lilies in cultivation. It differs from Brownii
and all the forms of Longiflorum in many respects. Note the following
marked differences: Its broader, fewer and more spreading
leaves, the shape of the entire flower and broader claw of its divisions,
its shorter anthers with pollen tinged with red. The flower
is solitary and large, interior pure white, exterior of a pinkish-brown
color, tubular, bell-shaped, with spreading revolute tips; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
bud shows a rich golden tint. Bulb white, or whitish-yellow, never
red or brown, broad at the base, the scales which are somewhat
narrow and acute at the tip, the outer ones terminate at about
two-thirds of the height of the inner scales, whereas in Brownii the
scales are broad, and all pass up, overlapping, and terminate together
at the apex of the bulb, thus making the base much narrower
than the apex."</p>

<p>It is a native of Japan, and is so exceedingly rare that it is priced
at $7.00, more than double the cost of any other in the list.
Brownii was priced, when a novelty at $4.00, but is now offered
for $1.75.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 319px;">
<img src="images/i_149.jpg" width="319" height="300" alt="Easter Lily" />
</div>

<p><i>Candidum</i>, sometimes called Easter
Lily, is one of the best known and
commonly grown of all the Lilies.
It has been in cultivation for about
three hundred years. Bears a profusion
of pure white fragrant flowers in
a compact head.</p>

<p>The double <i>Tiger Lily</i> is a very
great improvement on the old single
variety. It is very double, and very showy. <i>Wallacei</i> is a new Japanese
variety, said to be magnificent; color, buff, spotted with black.</p>

<p><i>Chalcedonicum</i> or <i>Scarlet Martagon</i> is supposed to be the "Lily
of the field" mentioned in the Gospel. "It is magnificent, and its
intense scarlet is one of the finest shades in the whole vegetable
kingdom. A full bed is a most magnificent sight, and if suddenly
looked at on a bright day, has nearly the same effect for a moment
as if looking at the sun. It is much scarcer than it should be, and
requires careful culture, to be planted about six or eight inches
deep, and watered in the summer time. It pleases every one who
is capable of being pleased."</p>

<p>Lilies, as well as many other bloomers, are greatly improved by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
thinning out the overplus, thus concentrating the sap to fewer blossoms,
which being thus liberally nourished, greatly increase in size,
and amply repay, by their superiority, for the loss in numbers.
Although this is a demonstrated fact, yet few have the courage to
prune where flowers are not very abundant, and many will not
when they are.</p>

<p>Those who have limited space are loth to devote much room to
Lilies, preferring plants that bloom continually throughout the season,
or that make more show. But it is not essential that the bed
should be devoted exclusively to lilies. For early spring blooming
there can be the Crocuses, Snowdrops, Hyacinths, Tulips, all of
which will bloom before the lilies, and after flowering can be taken
up, i.e., the Tulips and Hyacinths, and low bedding plants take
their places. Portulaca, Pansy, Ageratum, Mignonnette, Nemophila,
Sweet Alyssum, are all suitable for this purpose, and will
not only make the bed beautiful all the season with their blossoms,
but will also be of real benefit to the Lilies by shading their roots
somewhat, and keeping the soil more cool and moist.</p>

<p>Lilies must never be crowded; a foot or twenty inches is about
right. The soil should be dug deep and mixed with old rotted manure
and sand liberally, unless the soil is naturally sandy; if heavy,
clayey soil, it ought to have in addition to sharp sand, leaf mold
and bog muck. Plant the bulbs from six to eight inches deep, according
to the size. Last autumn, in planting my Lily, Tulip, Hyacinth,
and other bulbs, I made a little bed for each of pure sand,
and then covered well with soil, over which was put a blanket of
old dressing, then, before snow, a covering of boughs. The bulbs
never came up so grandly, nor grew so rapidly before. October is
the best month for bedding out, later will do, and many do not
plant their Lilies till the frost is out in the spring.</p>

<p>The two leading Lily growers of this country are John L. Child
and V. H. Hallock &amp; Thorp, of Queens, N. Y.</p>

<h3><a id="DOUBLE_WHITE_BOUVARDIA"></a>DOUBLE WHITE BOUVARDIA, "ALFRED NEUNER."</h3>

<p><img src="images/i_151b.jpg" class="dropcap" alt="T" title="T" height="95" width="53" />
<span class="hidden">T</span>HIS is indeed a novelty among this class of valuable plants,
being the first double ever known. It is said to be equal
if not superior, in profuse blooming quality, and vigorous,
healthy growth, to the single white variety, <i>Davidsonii</i>, of
which it is a sport. The flowers are rather larger than those of
the single flowering, and composed of three perfect rows of petals,
of the purest waxy white color, each floweret resembling a miniature
Tuberose. The trusses are large and perfect, and are freely
and without interruption produced, even on the small side shoots,
which generally make no flowers on the single one. It is highly
praised by Mr. Thomas Meehan, florist and editor of the <i>Gardeners'
Monthly</i>, and by Mr. Henry A. Dreer, florist, of Philadelphia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
"A grand thing," says Mr. Meehan. "Gives great satisfaction.
It has excelled our expectation," says Mr. Dreer.</p>

<p>My own specimen, about four inches in height, has twelve buds;
two small clusters are on side-shoots. The very fine illustration
of this Bouvardia we give our readers, has been kindly loaned by
the Ellis Brothers, Keene, N. H., who have a fine stock which they
are offering to the public.</p>

<p>Mr. Henry Cannell says, "Of all plants the Bouvardia, in our
opinion, excels for cut flowers, no matter either for button-hole bouquets
or table decoration; a spray of it is sure to be most prominent
and pleasing, and the odor of several kinds is deliciously refreshing,
and if well-grown they will more or less continue flowering
nine months out of the year. Strange to say, they need only
the ordinary course of cultivation of the winter-flowering Zonal
Pelargonium; hitherto they have been treated as a stove plant,
whereas they only need a temperature not higher than 50° to 60°,
and in the summer to have every attention, like a specimen Chrysanthemum,
and on the first appearance of frost to be taken into
the house, and when growing and flowering, to be supplied with
liquid manure occasionally."</p>

<p>Our only experience with this genus has been with <i>Bouvardia
Humboldtii Corymbiflora</i>, and it has proved to be a very valuable
plant. Its pure white flowers are produced in large trusses; their
tubes are three inches in length, and very fragrant. It blooms very
freely and for a long period. This variety and <i>Vreelandii</i> are the
best single white.</p>

<p><i>Liantha</i> is a dazzling scarlet, and a very profuse bloomer. <i>Elegans</i>,
salmon-scarlet; large and fine. <i>Lady Hyslop</i>, a light rose.
<i>Canspicua</i> is of a blood-red color, with whitish tube. <i>Bicolor</i>, a
summer-flowering variety. Flower tube purple, with tint of blue
and delicately mottled flesh, tipped with white. These last we find,
only in Cannell's <i>Floral Guide</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>I have no difficulty in keeping my Bouvardia in the cellar, the
leaves drop off, but they come out anew in the spring.</p>


<h3><a id="CAMELLIA_JAPONICA"></a>CAMELLIA JAPONICA.</h3>

<p>This is a very popular genus on account of their rich dark-green
leaves, and beautiful rose-like flowers. They are hardy greenhouse
plants, and thrive best in light loam mixed with sand and peat, but
will do well in light soil without the peat. It will not flourish in a
limestone soil. Mr. Vick gives the following in his Magazine:</p>

<p>"The Camellia Japonica was sent to England in 1739 by Father
Kamel, a missionary, for whom it was named. As a house-plant
the Camellia requires considerable care, on account of the tendency
of the flower buds to drop off. A northern exposure is best, and a
temperature of from forty to fifty degrees. When the buds are
swelling, water plentifully with warm water, but allow none to
stand in the saucer. Sponge the leaves once a week. In the
spring put the plant out in a shady place on the north side of a
house or fence, not under the drip of trees, and water it every day.
Set the pots on a hard bottom, so that no worms can get into them.
They form their flower beds during the summer, and at this time a
good growth of wood must be encouraged.</p>

<p>"In the Southern States the Camellia can be raised with not more
than ordinary care; at the North it must be considered entirely a
green-house plant, and as such will always be highly prized. We
are often asked how it should be cared for as a house-plant, and to
all such, in the northern part of the country, where it is necessary
to maintain good fires in warm houses for several months of the
year, we have no hesitation in saying, let it alone, do not expend
care and labor where there is so little prospect of reward."</p>

<p>Camellias are of many hues, and some are beautifully striped.
<i>Gen. Lafayette</i>, bright rose, striped with white, imbricated. <i>Bell
Romann</i>, imbricated, large flower and petals, rose striated with
bright crimson. <i>Matteo Molfino</i>, petals cerise, with pure white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
band down center. <i>Mrs. Lurmann</i>, crimson, spotted, very beautiful.
Pure colors of white, red, crimson, rose and carmine, can be obtained.</p>


<p><span class="smcap"><a id="Azalea">Azalea.</a></span>&mdash;Shrubby green-house plants of easy cultivation. Very
showy and hardy. Like the Camellia, they are found in all the
leading colors, and also striped, blotched and spotted. They are
both single and double.</p>

<p><i>Alexander II</i>, is white, striped with vermilion; edges of petals
fringed. <i>Aurelia</i>, white, striped with rosy orange, amaranth spots.
<i>Flag of Truce</i>, is a pure double white, very fine. <i>Her Majesty</i>, is
rosy-lilac, edged with white. <i>Alice</i>, rose, blotched with vermilion;
double.</p>

<p>Mr. Vick gives the following directions: "Azaleas need a light
soil of sandy loam, to which should be added one-half leaf mold.
Repotting should be done in May, trimming the tops to bring
them into shape. Then plunge in some sheltered spot in the
garden. In September the plants should be brought in under
cover, or into a cool room. They do best when the temperature
ranges from forty degrees at night to sixty-five or seventy by day.
The foliage should be showered once a week, but care must be
taken that the roots are not over-watered, as they rot easily.
Small plants bloom well, but their beauty increases as they get age
and size. The flowers appear on the terminal shoots, and are from
one inch to two and a half inches in diameter.</p>

<p>"Azaleas if left to themselves will develop long shoots, that after
a time become naked below and are furnished with leaves only at
their extremities. Flower stems are formed on the new wood of
each summer's growth, consequently the amount of bloom, other
things being equal, depends upon the amount of new wood annually
produced. In order to have plants of good shape when they become
large, it is necessary to give attention to pinching and training
them from the first. The pyramid form, or more properly that
of a cone, and rounded at the top, is considered the best for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
plant, as it allows the greatest exposure of leaf-surface. Two principal
methods are adopted to regulate the growth and bring plants
into shape: one is by successive pinchings as the growth proceeds,
the other by allowing long shoots to grow and then bending and
training them down, thus causing many of the dormant buds along
their whole length to break and develop into shoots. A skillful
combination of the two methods is probably better than either exclusively."</p>

<p>Mr. John Dick, Philadelphia, has the largest stock of Camellias
and Azaleas, it is stated, in the United States. Their catalogue
list of these plants embraces more than a hundred varieties, to
which we refer our readers.</p>

<span class="hidden">W</span>E have come to see your garden, said a gentleman with a
lady in company. They were from a neighboring town.
This two weeks after the heavy frost!</p>

<p>I told them my garden was in the stable, and thither
I piloted them. It was not a very small garden if it was in a stable.
A hundred or more plants had been hurriedly removed from
the beds the day before that freezing night! There they were, in
the soiled pots just as taken from the ground, or packed closely in
boxes. Not very attractive looking, in one sense, yet in another
they were, for they were bright, healthy appearing plants&mdash;leaves
as fresh as when in the open air, pretty Geraniums in bloom, a mass
of Lobelia, attractive with their tiny blue flowers, Coleus of varied
hues, and even a few Roses struggling into bloom.</p>

<p>Then we strolled among the despoiled beds, and the Pansies, so
large and pert, elicited admiration, and the Sweet Peas, just as fragrant
as though blight were not all around them, while dear little
Mignonnette seemed to have taken a new lease of life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Yesterday I arranged in a shallow glass dish as handsome a bouquet
as I have had for the season. Sweet Clover sprays, Mignonnette
and fragrant Geranium leaves for the foundation all around the
dish, a few bunches of the little white wax balls, with their glossy
leaves, Geranium blossoms, and lots of Sweet Peas, from the most
delicate shades to the deepest, and bunches of splendid Pansies,
Sweet Alyssum, a bit of purple Verbena here and there, and white-eyed
Phlox. It was just lovely.</p>

<p>When the evidence was sure that frost was surely coming, and a
great many plants must be taken up in a few hours' time, I was so
glad that full half of them were in pots. I could never have potted
a third of them in the time. The great object was to get them
sheltered, and the repotting could be done at my leisure.</p>

<p>But I almost changed my mind the other day after toiling several
hours at the business. So many pots to wash! then fill with
fresh earth, and set the plant. O dear, wasn't I tired! But then
the wide door was open, the day was lovely, and I rather think
potting plants in a stable is better than potting out of doors on a
cold day, and when one is in a great hurry. Plants that are in
pots plunged in the ground do not grow so many roots, and that
is another advantage.</p>


<h3><a id="MY_WINDOW_BOX">MY WINDOW BOX.</a></h3>

<p>Perhaps I may as well tell you about my most important window
box. I had it made last autumn, and I was greatly pleased
with it. It is made of zinc, size one yard long, fourteen inches
broad, seven inches in depth. To give it strength it is framed at
the top with wood. You can have this of black walnut, or stained
in imitation. You can have the box painted any color you wish,
or leave it unpainted. In the center is Croton "Weismanni," on
one side of it a fine Eranthemum pictum; its green leaves look as
though they were painted with white streaks; on the other side,
Acalypha "Macafeeana." These are the largest plants in my box,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
and they do not exceed ten inches in height. There are sixty
plants in all, mostly averaging six inches in height, but a few are
quite small. They consist of very choice Geraniums&mdash;some of
them handsome-leaved&mdash;variegated Abutilons, Lemon Verbena,
two bright Achyranthes, six very beautiful Coleuses, and four fine
Begonias. There are others I cannot stop to specify. You will
see that I have filled my box with what are, in themselves, beautiful
without the aid of flowers, though I expect to have a few of
these by-and-by. I am perfectly satisfied with it, however, just as
it is. I had a large German Ivy growing out of doors, which consisted
of several long vines. This I planted in one corner of the
box, and then drooped and twined it on the outside. The change
to indoor life caused the large green leaves to fall off, but already
new ones have put forth, and the vines are rapidly growing. Everything
else had been previously prepared so that there was no
change in their leafage after being put in the box. It is a great
addition to the beauty of the box to have vines of pretty foliage
drape the sides. This autumn I have had it placed on a small, low
table with castors, so I can change the plants every week, and thus
avoid that turning toward the window which they always assume
if kept in one position.</p>

<p>I first put in drainage, and then filled the box with rich, mellow
earth in which was a mixture of one-third sand. I have been thus
particular in my description, for many, no doubt, who, like myself,
have to make the most of limited space, will be glad to know just
how to keep the greatest number of plants to the best advantage.
Not only is there a saving of room, but of labor, and it is more
cleanly.</p>


<h3><a id="HYACINTHS">HYACINTHS.</a></h3>

<p>Among the essentials for winter flowers are the bulbs. Of these
the hyacinth takes the lead. They are so easily grown; so lovely
and so fragrant that they are worthy of a place in every collection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
They should be planted so that the upper surface of the bulb is
visible. Water liberally and then put away in a cool dark place
for several weeks, six weeks is none too long, and some I allow to
remain a longer time, bringing them to the light at intervals so as to
have a succession of flowers. They are very effective planted in a
group. They are very pretty in hyacinth glasses, but this method
ruins the bulbs for future use. Planted out they will sometimes
flower. The best time to plant them in the border is in October,
but the first of November will do. It is a good plan to make a
little bed of sand for the bulb, and then cover with light porous
soil. Hyacinths are classed as tall and dwarf, single and double.
The Roman Hyacinth is the earliest bloomer, coming into flower
about the holidays if started in season. The spikes are small and
flowers rather scattering. As soon as the blooms fade, the stalk
should be removed, and when the leaves turn yellow, they can be
cut off, and the bulb dried and packed in paper bags and kept till
time for autumn planting.</p>

<p>Hyacinth bulbs come from Holland. About Haarlem the rubbish
heaps are hyacinths, and the air is oppressive with their perfume.</p>

<p>In California there grows what is called the Twining Hyacinth.
It grows in the mountains, and twines about the bushes, sometimes
going up eight and ten feet. After it gets to the top of the bush
and rests awhile, it lets go of the earth and goes on blooming for
months, regardless of the burning sun. The flower stem breaks
off near the ground, and the flowers are kept swinging in the air
supported only by the bush about which it twines. The color is
deep rose, and it is said to be very pretty. The picture of it certainly
looks attractive. It is a large cluster composed of dozens of
blossoms.</p>

<p>For flowering in the house the Polyanthus Narcissus are very
desirable. They can be put into glasses as well as the Hyacinth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
but the most natural method is in a pot of earth, and the bulb is in a
better condition for after use. The Jonquils are also pretty. Snowdrops,
Scillas and the Crocus are cheap bulbs, and planted in the autumn will
show their bright, sweet faces soon after the snow is gone. They are
also very fine for house culture. Should be planted in groups.</p>

<p>Tulips ought to have a place in every garden. They make a brilliant
show in the Spring, when the beds are bare of other flowers, and afford
bloom for a long time, if a good assortment is selected. The pretty little
dwarf Duc Van Thols are early bloomers and very gay. They are admirable
also for the house, and by planting in September, will come into
flower in December. There are early single and double Tulips, and also
late bloomers, so that by having a variety, the border may look gay for a
long time. The Parrot Tulips are large and very brilliant in color, and
picturesque in appearance. All of these varieties succeed in ordinary
garden soil. They ought to be planted in October or November, about
four to six inches apart, and about four inches under the surface. Before
severe frost they need to be protected by branches of evergreen,
straw or leaves. After blooming, and the leaves have died down, they
can be taken up, dried and stored till autumn, if the bed is needed for
other flowers.</p>

<p>The Bulb catalogues issued by leading florists in the autumn, and
sent free to all applicants, will enable you to select just what you want.</p>

<h3><a id="INSECTS">INSECTS.</a></h3>

<p>In a work of this character it seems needful to treat more fully of
those pests which prove so destructive to plant life, than we have in our
brief references.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Aphis</span> or green louse is the one that most frequently infests our
plants, and the rapidity with which it multiplies, is astonishing. <span class="smcap">Reaumer</span>
has proved that in five generations one aphis may be the progenitor
of six thousand millions, and there may be ten generations in a year!</p>

<p>The method most generally adopted for their destruction is fumigation
with tobacco. As this is attended with considerable difficulty, a weak
solution may be used quite as effectively. We have had no experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
with either method, having used another with good success for several
years. This is white hellebore which we usually apply in the powder
when the Rose-bushes are wet with dew or rain, bending the branches
over, so that the application can be made chiefly on the under side of
the leaves, where the pests are found. Two or three times proves sufficient.
For our house plants we usually make a solution, by putting half
an ounce of the hellebore into pretty warm water, and letting it stand
for several hours, stirring it up however, before spraying the leaves.
Afterward, the plants need to be washed.</p>

<p>For the <span class="smcap">Scale</span> a strong solution of soap-suds applied with a sponge or
a small stiff brush. A tooth brush is very suitable for this purpose.</p>

<p>For <span class="smcap">Mealy Bug</span>, a mixture of one part alcohol and three parts water,
applying with a feather, or what is better, a camel hair brush. Another
method is to use kerosene in the same way. A florist who has practiced
this for eight years, says it is sure death to the insect. The feather
should be brushed all over the mealy-looking substances found usually
in the axils of the leaves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worms in Pots.</span> Lime water is a safe and effectual remedy for the
little white worms often found in the soil. Slake the lime in water and
after it has settled, pour off the clear water and drench the earth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ants.</span> Various remedies have proved effective. One is to take a
vial or a cup nearly filled with sweet oil, and sink it in the ground where
the ants resort, so that the rim is on a level with the surface. The ants
are very fond of it, but it is sure death to them.</p>

<p>A German writer says that carbolic acid and water will drive ants
away from any grounds&mdash;one hundred parts of water to one of the acid.
Mix in a tub and stir repeatedly for twenty-four hours, taking off the
scum that rises to the top.</p>

<p>Kerosene or coal-oil mixed with water has proved very successful in
the destruction of noxious insects and grubs. A tablespoonful of the
oil to two gallons of water is the rule for tender plants; for hardy ones
it will be necessary probably to have it of greater strength. As the compound
does not mix readily, it needs to be thoroughly stirred, and then
quickly applied. The best way is to draw it back and forth a few times
in a syringe, and then apply.</p>

<p>Water tainted with coal-oil, poured into little holes made in mole
tracks, will, it is said, drive them effectually away.</p>

<h2>"AN ESSAY ON ROSES."</h2>

<h3>NOTICES OF THE PRESS.</h3>


<p>Mrs. M. D. Wellcome of Yarmouth, Me., whose pleasant and helpful
"Talks About Flowers" are familiar to the readers of <i>The Journal</i>, has
published in a neat pamphlet, <i>An Essay on Roses</i>, which was read before
the Maine Pomological Convention last March, and has since been revised
and enlarged for publication. This essay treats the subject historically
and descriptively. It considers the classification of Roses, tells
what Roses to plant, gives suggestions as to the best mode of culture,
and furnishes a list of the best hybrids and of the best ever-blooming
varieties. Mrs. Wellcome writes with enthusiasm, and from a thorough
knowledge and a considerable experience. All lovers of roses, and all
amateur horticulturists will find the little monograph interesting and
suggestive.</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Boston Journal.</i></p>

<p>The valuable and instructive <i>Essay on Roses</i> read before the Maine
Pomological Convention by Mrs. M. D. Wellcome, has been issued in a
neat pamphlet.... Our readers who are familiar with Mrs. Wellcome's
writings, will know how to value this production of her busy pen.</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Portland Transcript.</i></p>

<p>Our well-appreciated correspondent, Mrs. M. D. Wellcome, has published
in a neat pamphlet, an essay upon "Roses."... It is an interesting
and practical little manual, and will prove a valuable aid to young
horticulturists.</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Zion's Herald.</i></p>

<p>The <i>Waterville Mail</i> says: "Of this essay it is sufficient to say that
it was prepared by a graceful writer,&mdash;a well-known contributor to the
literary department of several prominent Journals, and a skillful florist&mdash;and
that it secured the approbation of the Convention before whom it
was read, and the representatives of the agricultural press."</p>

<p>Rev. J. M. Orrock, editor of <i>Messiah's Herald</i>, after describing the
work, adds: "The author says in her introduction, 'I have brought you
a bouquet of Roses, and there is little of my own but the string that
binds them.' It is indeed, a pretty bouquet, and we hope many of her
friends will want to see and enjoy it."</p>

<p>Mr. Samuel L. Boardman Esq., editor of the <i>Home Farm</i>, says:
"This little booklet about Roses is just the plain, sensible guide all amateur
growers will be profited by reading. There is just enough of history
and sentiment in its opening pages, ample directions for culture,
treatment, etc., closing with descriptions of the most desirable Roses,
and lists from which to make selections for larger cultivators. Mechanically,
the little book is as delicate as a rosebud; and every lover of this
queenly flower should procure a copy."</p>

<p>The "Essay" is issued in a neatly illustrated pamphlet of 24 pages,
with ornamental cover. Price 15 cents. For sale by the author, Yarmouth,
